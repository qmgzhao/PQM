LindaHill_2014X_1 i'm a business professor whose ambition has been to help people learn to lead
LindaHill_2014X_2 but recently i've discovered that what many of us think of as great leadership does not work when it comes to leading innovation 
LindaHill_2014X_3 i'm an ethnographer i use the methods of anthropology to understand the questions in which i'm interested so along with 
LindaHill_2014X_8 the bottom line if we want to build organizations that can innovate time and again we must unlearn our conventional notions of leadership
LindaHill_2014X_11 innovation is anything that is both new and useful
LindaHill_2014X_14 keep your hands up if you know who this is
LindaHill_2014X_19 movie in the twenty years hence they've produced fourteen movies i was recently at pixar and i'm here to tell you that number fifteen is sure to be a winner
LindaHill_2014X_20 when many of us think about innovation though we think about an einstein having an' aha
LindaHill_2014X_24 on the contrary it takes about two hundred and fifty people four to five years to make one of those
LindaHill_2014X_27 even with all those arrows he thought it failed to really tell you just how iterative interrelated and frankly messy their process was
LindaHill_2014X_29 so think about it some shots go through quickly 
LindaHill_2014X_32 that ten seconds took one animator almost six months to perfect
LindaHill_2014X_39 what we know is at the heart of innovation is a paradox
LindaHill_2014X_42 innovation is a journey 
LindaHill_2014X_44 innovations rarely get created full blown
LindaHill_2014X_56 in innovative organizations they amplify differences they don't minimize them
LindaHill_2014X_57 creative abrasion is not about brainstorming where people suspend their judgment
LindaHill_2014X_60 they understand that innovation rarely happens unless
LindaHill_2014X_61 you have both diversity and conflict
LindaHill_2014X_66 pilots are often about being right when they don't work someone or something is to blame 
LindaHill_2014X_71 when you look at innovative organizations they never go along to get along they don't compromise they don't let one group or one individual dominate even if it's the boss even if it's the expert 
LindaHill_2014X_74 these three capabilities are why we see that pixar is able to do what it does
LindaHill_2014X_75 let me give you another example and that example is the infrastructure group of google
LindaHill_2014X_76 the infrastructure group of google is the group that has to keep the website up and running twenty four
LindaHill_2014X_77 so when google was about to introduce gmail and youtube they knew that their data storage system wasn't adequate 
LindaHill_2014X_83 two groups coalesced one became known as big table the other became known as build it from scratch
LindaHill_2014X_84 big table proposed that they build on the current system build it from scratch proposed that it was time for a whole new system
LindaHill_2014X_86 in engineering reviews bill described his role as injecting honesty into the process
LindaHill_2014X_89 when build it from scratch shared their prototype with the group whose beepers would have to go off in the
LindaHill_2014X_90 middle of the night if something went wrong with the website they heard loud and clear about the limitations of their particular design
LindaHill_2014X_93 build it from scratch team bill asked two members of that team to join a new team that was emerging to work on the next generation system
LindaHill_2014X_95 early in that process one of the engineers had gone to bill and said we're all too busy for this inefficient system of running parallel experiments
LindaHill_2014X_96 but as the process unfolded he began to understand the wisdom of allowing talented people to play out their passions he admitted if you had forced us to all be on one team 
LindaHill_2014X_103 but it's a different kind of leadership not the kind many of us think about when we think about great leadership
LindaHill_2014X_104 one of the leaders i met with early on said to me linda i don't read books on leadership
LindaHill_2014X_106 in the first chapter they say i'm supposed to create a vision 
LindaHill_2014X_107 but if i'm trying to do something that's truly new i have no answers i don't know what direction we're going in and i'm not even sure i know how to figure out how to get there
LindaHill_2014X_110 is about creating the space where people are willing and able to do the hard work of innovative problem solving
LindaHill_2014X_111 at this point some of you may be wondering what does that leadership really look like at pixar
LindaHill_2014X_113 the leaders focus on building a sense of community and building those three capabilities
LindaHill_2014X_116 what do they focus their time on not on creating a vision instead they spend their time thinking about how do we design a studio that has the sensibility
LindaHill_2014X_117 of a public public square so that people will interact
LindaHill_2014X_118 let's put in a policy that anyone no matter what their level or role is allowed to give notes to the director about how they feel about a particular film
LindaHill_2014X_119 what can we do to make sure that all the disruptors all the minority voices in this organization speak up and are heard and
LindaHill_2014X_120 let's bestow credit in a very generous way i don't know if you've ever looked at the credits of a pixar movie but the babies born during a production are listed there laughter
LindaHill_2014X_121 how did bill think about what his role was
LindaHill_2014X_123 they want to cocreate with me the future 
LindaHill_2014X_124 my job is to nurture the bottom up and not let it degenerate
LindaHill_2014X_126 how did he see his role i'm a role model i'm a human glue i'm a connector i'm an aggregator of viewpoints i'm never a dictator of viewpoints
LindaHill_2014X_131 where people are willing and able to share and combine their talents and passions
LindaHill_2014X_135 we studied the head of marketing at a german automaker where fundamentally they believed that it was the design engineers not the marketeers who were allowed to be innovative 
LindaHill_2014X_136 we also studied vineet nayar at hcl technologies an indian outsourcing company
LindaHill_2014X_137 when we met vineet his company was about in his words to become irrelevant we watched as he turned that company into a global dynamo of i t innovation
LindaHill_2014X_139 what he did
LindaHill_2014X_142 so they began to work on that they stopped giving answers they stopped trying to provide solutions 
LindaHill_2014X_145 they began to transfer the organization's growth to that level
LindaHill_2014X_147 happening every day
LindaHill_2014X_149 for sure they understood that that was not their role 
LindaHill_2014X_150 so i don't think it is accidental that many of you did not recognize ed
LindaHill_2014X_152 if we want to invent a better future and i suspect that's why many of us are here 
LindaHill_2014X_153 then we need to reimagine our task
LindaHill_2014X_154 our task is to create the space
LindaHill_2014X_156 can be unleashed and harnessed and turned into works of collective genius thank you
