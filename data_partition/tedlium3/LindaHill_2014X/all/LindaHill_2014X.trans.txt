LindaHill_2014X_0 a confession to make 
LindaHill_2014X_1 i'm a business professor whose ambition has been to help people learn to lead
LindaHill_2014X_2 but recently i've discovered that what many of us think of as great leadership does not work when it comes to leading innovation 
LindaHill_2014X_3 i'm an ethnographer i use the methods of anthropology to understand the questions in which i'm interested so along with 
LindaHill_2014X_4 i spent nearly a decade observing up close and personal exceptional leaders of innovation
LindaHill_2014X_5 we studied sixteen men and women located in seven countries across the globe working in twelve different industries
LindaHill_2014X_6 in total we spent hundreds of hours on the ground
LindaHill_2014X_7 watching these leaders in action we ended up with pages and pages and pages of field notes that we analyzed and looked for patterns in what our leaders did
LindaHill_2014X_8 the bottom line if we want to build organizations that can innovate time and again we must unlearn our conventional notions of leadership
LindaHill_2014X_9 leading innovation is not about creating a vision and inspiring others to execute it but
LindaHill_2014X_10 what do we
LindaHill_2014X_11 innovation is anything that is both new and useful
LindaHill_2014X_12 it can be a product or service it can be a process or a way of organizing it can be incremental or it can be breakthrough we have a pretty inclusive definition
LindaHill_2014X_13 how many of you recognize this man put your hands up
LindaHill_2014X_14 keep your hands up if you know who this is
LindaHill_2014X_15 from your show of hands it looks like many of you have seen a pixar movie but very few of you recognized ed catmull
LindaHill_2014X_16 the founder and ceo of pixar one of the companies i had the privilege of studying
LindaHill_2014X_17 my first visit to pixar was in two thousand and five when they were working on ratatouille that provocative movie about a rat
LindaHill_2014X_18 movies are really mainstream today but it took ed and his colleagues nearly twenty years to create the first
LindaHill_2014X_19 movie in the twenty years hence they've produced fourteen movies i was recently at pixar and i'm here to tell you that number fifteen is sure to be a winner
LindaHill_2014X_20 when many of us think about innovation though we think about an einstein having an' aha
LindaHill_2014X_21 but we all know that's a myth innovation is not about solo genius it's about collective genius
LindaHill_2014X_22 let's think for a minute about what it takes to make a pixar movie
LindaHill_2014X_23 no solo genius no flash of inspiration produces one of those movies
LindaHill_2014X_24 on the contrary it takes about two hundred and fifty people four to five years to make one of those
LindaHill_2014X_25 to help us understand the process an individual in the studio drew a version of this picture
LindaHill_2014X_26 he did so reluctantly because it suggested that the process was a neat series of steps done by discrete groups
LindaHill_2014X_27 even with all those arrows he thought it failed to really tell you just how iterative interrelated and frankly messy their process was
LindaHill_2014X_28 throughout the making of a movie at pixar the story evolves
LindaHill_2014X_29 so think about it some shots go through quickly 
LindaHill_2014X_30 they don't all go through in order it depends on how vexing the challenges are that they come up with when they are working on a particular scene
LindaHill_2014X_31 so if you think about that scene in up where the boy hands the piece of chocolate to the bird
LindaHill_2014X_32 that ten seconds took one animator almost six months to perfect
LindaHill_2014X_33 the other thing about a pixar movie is that no part of the movie is considered finished until the entire movie wraps
LindaHill_2014X_34 partway through one production an animator drew a character with an arched eyebrow that suggested a mischievous side
LindaHill_2014X_35 when the director saw that drawing he thought it was great it was beautiful but he said you've got to lose it it
LindaHill_2014X_36 weeks later the director came back and said let's put in those few seconds of film
LindaHill_2014X_37 because that animator was allowed to share what we referred to as his slice of genius 
LindaHill_2014X_38 he was able to help that director reconceive the character in a subtle but important way that really improved the story
LindaHill_2014X_39 what we know is at the heart of innovation is a paradox
LindaHill_2014X_40 you have to unleash the talents and passions of many people and you have to harness
LindaHill_2014X_41 them into a work that is actually useful
LindaHill_2014X_42 innovation is a journey 
LindaHill_2014X_43 it's a type of collaborative problem solving usually among people who have different expertise and different points of view 
LindaHill_2014X_44 innovations rarely get created full blown
LindaHill_2014X_45 as many of you know they're the result usually of trial and error lots of false starts missteps and mistakes
LindaHill_2014X_46 innovative work can be very exhilarating but it also can be really downright scary 
LindaHill_2014X_47 so when we look at why it is that pixar is able to do what it does we have to ask ourselves
LindaHill_2014X_48 what's going on here
LindaHill_2014X_49 for sure history and certainly hollywood is full of star studded teams that have failed
LindaHill_2014X_50 most of those failures are attributed to too many stars or too many cooks if you will in the kitchen
LindaHill_2014X_51 so why is it that pixar with all of its cooks is able to be so successful time and time again 
LindaHill_2014X_52 when we studied an islamic bank in dubai or a luxury brand in korea
LindaHill_2014X_53 or a social enterprise in africa we found that innovative organizations are communities that have three capabilities 
LindaHill_2014X_54 creative abrasion creative agility and creative resolution 
LindaHill_2014X_55 creative abrasion is about being able to create a marketplace of ideas through debate and discourse
LindaHill_2014X_56 in innovative organizations they amplify differences they don't minimize them
LindaHill_2014X_57 creative abrasion is not about brainstorming where people suspend their judgment
LindaHill_2014X_58 know how to have very heated but constructive arguments to create a portfolio of alternatives 
LindaHill_2014X_59 individuals in innovative organizations learn how to inquire they learn how to actively listen but guess what they also learn how to advocate for their point of view 
LindaHill_2014X_60 they understand that innovation rarely happens unless
LindaHill_2014X_61 you have both diversity and conflict
LindaHill_2014X_62 creative agility is about being able to test and refine that portfolio of ideas through quick pursuit reflection and adjustment 
LindaHill_2014X_63 it's about discovery driven learning where you act as opposed to plan your way to the future it's about design thinking where you have that interesting combination of the scientific method
LindaHill_2014X_64 and the artistic process it's about running a series of experiments and not a series of pilots experiments are usually about
LindaHill_2014X_65 learning when you get a negative outcome you're still really learning something that you need to know
LindaHill_2014X_66 pilots are often about being right when they don't work someone or something is to blame 
LindaHill_2014X_67 the final capability is creative resolution
LindaHill_2014X_68 this is about doing decision making in a way that you can actually combine even opposing ideas to reconfigure them in new combinations
LindaHill_2014X_69 to produce a solution that is new and
LindaHill_2014X_70 useful 
LindaHill_2014X_71 when you look at innovative organizations they never go along to get along they don't compromise they don't let one group or one individual dominate even if it's the boss even if it's the expert 
LindaHill_2014X_72 instead they have developed a rather patient and more inclusive decision making process that allows for both and solutions to arise and not simply either
LindaHill_2014X_73 or solutions
LindaHill_2014X_74 these three capabilities are why we see that pixar is able to do what it does
LindaHill_2014X_75 let me give you another example and that example is the infrastructure group of google
LindaHill_2014X_76 the infrastructure group of google is the group that has to keep the website up and running twenty four
LindaHill_2014X_77 so when google was about to introduce gmail and youtube they knew that their data storage system wasn't adequate 
LindaHill_2014X_78 the head of the engineering group and the infrastructure group at that time was a man named bill coughran
LindaHill_2014X_79 bill and his leadership team who he referred to as his brain trust had to figure out what to do about this situation 
LindaHill_2014X_80 they thought about it for a while instead of creating a group to tackle this task they decided to allow groups
LindaHill_2014X_81 to emerge spontaneously
LindaHill_2014X_82 around different alternatives 
LindaHill_2014X_83 two groups coalesced one became known as big table the other became known as build it from scratch
LindaHill_2014X_84 big table proposed that they build on the current system build it from scratch proposed that it was time for a whole new system
LindaHill_2014X_85 these two teams were allowed to work full time on their particular approach
LindaHill_2014X_86 in engineering reviews bill described his role as injecting honesty into the process
LindaHill_2014X_87 by driving debate
LindaHill_2014X_88 early on the teams were encouraged to build prototypes so that they could bump them up against reality and discover for themselves the strengths and weaknesses of their particular approach
LindaHill_2014X_89 when build it from scratch shared their prototype with the group whose beepers would have to go off in the
LindaHill_2014X_90 middle of the night if something went wrong with the website they heard loud and clear about the limitations of their particular design
LindaHill_2014X_91 as the need for a solution became more urgent and as the data or the evidence began to come in it became pretty clear that the big table solution was the right one for the moment 
LindaHill_2014X_92 so they selected that one but to make sure that they did not lose the learning of the
LindaHill_2014X_93 build it from scratch team bill asked two members of that team to join a new team that was emerging to work on the next generation system
LindaHill_2014X_94 this whole process took nearly two years but i was told that they were all working at breakneck speed
LindaHill_2014X_95 early in that process one of the engineers had gone to bill and said we're all too busy for this inefficient system of running parallel experiments
LindaHill_2014X_96 but as the process unfolded he began to understand the wisdom of allowing talented people to play out their passions he admitted if you had forced us to all be on one team 
LindaHill_2014X_97 we might have focused on proving who was right and winning and not on learning and discovering what was the best answer for google
LindaHill_2014X_98 capabilities required for that they know how to do collaborative problem solving they know how to do discovery driven learning and they know how to do integrated decision making
LindaHill_2014X_99 some of you may be sitting there and saying to yourselves right now we don't know how to do those things in my organization so why do they know how to do those things at pixar and why do they know how to do those things at google
LindaHill_2014X_100 when many of the people that worked for bill told us
LindaHill_2014X_101 bill was one of the finest leaders in silicon valley we completely agreed the man is a genius
LindaHill_2014X_102 leadership is the secret sauce 
LindaHill_2014X_103 but it's a different kind of leadership not the kind many of us think about when we think about great leadership
LindaHill_2014X_104 one of the leaders i met with early on said to me linda i don't read books on leadership
LindaHill_2014X_105 all they do is make me feel bad
LindaHill_2014X_106 in the first chapter they say i'm supposed to create a vision 
LindaHill_2014X_107 but if i'm trying to do something that's truly new i have no answers i don't know what direction we're going in and i'm not even sure i know how to figure out how to get there
LindaHill_2014X_108 for sure there are times when visionary leadership is exactly what is needed but if we want to build organizations that can innovate time and again we
LindaHill_2014X_109 must recast our understanding of what leadership is about leading innovation
LindaHill_2014X_110 is about creating the space where people are willing and able to do the hard work of innovative problem solving
LindaHill_2014X_111 at this point some of you may be wondering what does that leadership really look like at pixar
LindaHill_2014X_112 they understand that innovation takes a village
LindaHill_2014X_113 the leaders focus on building a sense of community and building those three capabilities
LindaHill_2014X_114 how do they define leadership they say leadership is about creating a world to which people want to belong
LindaHill_2014X_115 what kind of world do people want to belong in at pixar a world where you're living at the frontier 
LindaHill_2014X_116 what do they focus their time on not on creating a vision instead they spend their time thinking about how do we design a studio that has the sensibility
LindaHill_2014X_117 of a public public square so that people will interact
LindaHill_2014X_118 let's put in a policy that anyone no matter what their level or role is allowed to give notes to the director about how they feel about a particular film
LindaHill_2014X_119 what can we do to make sure that all the disruptors all the minority voices in this organization speak up and are heard and
LindaHill_2014X_120 let's bestow credit in a very generous way i don't know if you've ever looked at the credits of a pixar movie but the babies born during a production are listed there laughter
LindaHill_2014X_121 how did bill think about what his role was
LindaHill_2014X_122 bill said i lead a volunteer organization talented people don't want to follow me anywhere 
LindaHill_2014X_123 they want to cocreate with me the future 
LindaHill_2014X_124 my job is to nurture the bottom up and not let it degenerate
LindaHill_2014X_125 into chaos
LindaHill_2014X_126 how did he see his role i'm a role model i'm a human glue i'm a connector i'm an aggregator of viewpoints i'm never a dictator of viewpoints
LindaHill_2014X_127 advice about how you exercise the role hire people who argue with you
LindaHill_2014X_128 and guess what sometimes it's best to be deliberately fuzzy and vague
LindaHill_2014X_129 some of you may be wondering now what are these people thinking
LindaHill_2014X_130 thinking i'm not the visionary i'm the social architect i'm creating the space
LindaHill_2014X_131 where people are willing and able to share and combine their talents and passions
LindaHill_2014X_132 if some of you are worrying now that you don't work at a pixar or you don't work at a google i want to tell you there's still hope 
LindaHill_2014X_133 we've studied many organizations that were really not organizations you'd think of as ones where a lot of innovation happens
LindaHill_2014X_134 we studied a general counsel in a pharmaceutical company who had to figure out how to get the outside lawyers nineteen competitors to collaborate and innovate
LindaHill_2014X_135 we studied the head of marketing at a german automaker where fundamentally they believed that it was the design engineers not the marketeers who were allowed to be innovative 
LindaHill_2014X_136 we also studied vineet nayar at hcl technologies an indian outsourcing company
LindaHill_2014X_137 when we met vineet his company was about in his words to become irrelevant we watched as he turned that company into a global dynamo of i t innovation
LindaHill_2014X_138 at hcl technologies like at many companies the leaders had learned to see their role as setting direction and making sure that no one deviated from it
LindaHill_2014X_139 what he did
LindaHill_2014X_140 is tell them
LindaHill_2014X_141 it was time for them to think about rethinking what they were supposed to do because what was happening is that everybody was looking up and you weren't seeing the kind of bottom up innovation we saw at pixar or google
LindaHill_2014X_142 so they began to work on that they stopped giving answers they stopped trying to provide solutions 
LindaHill_2014X_143 instead what they did is they began to see the people at the bottom of the pyramid the young sparks
LindaHill_2014X_144 the people who were closest to the customers as the source of innovation
LindaHill_2014X_145 they began to transfer the organization's growth to that level
LindaHill_2014X_146 in vineet's language this was about inverting the pyramid so that you could unleash the power of the many by loosening the stranglehold of the few and increase the quality and the speed of innovation that
LindaHill_2014X_147 happening every day
LindaHill_2014X_148 for sure vineet and all the other leaders that we studied were in fact visionaries
LindaHill_2014X_149 for sure they understood that that was not their role 
LindaHill_2014X_150 so i don't think it is accidental that many of you did not recognize ed
LindaHill_2014X_151 like vineet understands that our role as leaders is to set the stage not perform on it
LindaHill_2014X_152 if we want to invent a better future and i suspect that's why many of us are here 
LindaHill_2014X_153 then we need to reimagine our task
LindaHill_2014X_154 our task is to create the space
LindaHill_2014X_155 where everybody's slices of genius
LindaHill_2014X_156 can be unleashed and harnessed and turned into works of collective genius thank you
