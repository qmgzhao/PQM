MarcGoodman_2012G_2 and frankly i'm afraid i'm afraid by what i see i sincerely
MarcGoodman_2012G_4 and that's informed my perspective on things i've been a street police officer an undercover investigator a counter terrorism strategist and i've worked in more than seventy countries around the world 
MarcGoodman_2012G_12 but in the hands
MarcGoodman_2012G_14 technology and how criminals were using it as a young patrol officer in those days this was the height of technology
MarcGoodman_2012G_22 we consistently underestimate what criminals and terrorists can do
MarcGoodman_2012G_23 technology has made our world increasingly open and for the most part that's great but all of this openness may have unintended consequences 
MarcGoodman_2012G_26 explosives and hand grenades they threw these hand grenades at innocent people as they sat eating in cafes
MarcGoodman_2012G_27 and waited to catch trains on their way home from work 
MarcGoodman_2012G_28 but heavy artillery is nothing new in terrorist operations guns and bombs are nothing new
MarcGoodman_2012G_30 and slaughter them they were armed with mobile phones
MarcGoodman_2012G_34 this is an operations center and the terrorists built their very own op center across the border in pakistan where they monitored the bbc al jazeera
MarcGoodman_2012G_37 they did all of this in real time
MarcGoodman_2012G_38 the innovation of the terrorist operations center gave terrorists unparalleled situational awareness and tactical advantage over
MarcGoodman_2012G_39 the police
MarcGoodman_2012G_40 and over the government
MarcGoodman_2012G_44 are you and what are you doing here and the man replied i'm just an innocent schoolteacher of course the terrorists knew
MarcGoodman_2012G_47 where the terrorist war room googled him and found a picture and called their operatives on the ground and said
MarcGoodman_2012G_49 is he bald in front 
MarcGoodman_2012G_50 does he wear glasses
MarcGoodman_2012G_51 yes yes yes came the answers 
MarcGoodman_2012G_56 terrorists are doing this a search engine
MarcGoodman_2012G_60 in the end three hundred people were gravely wounded and over one hundred and
MarcGoodman_2012G_61 women and children lost their lives that day 
MarcGoodman_2012G_63 men armed not just with weapons but with technology were able to bring a city of twenty million people
MarcGoodman_2012G_64 to a standstill ten people brought twenty million people to a standstill and this traveled around the world this
MarcGoodman_2012G_65 this is what radicals can do with openness
MarcGoodman_2012G_66 this was done nearly four years ago what could terrorists do today with the technologies available that we have
MarcGoodman_2012G_68 the ability of one to affect many is scaling exponentially and it's scaling for good and it's scaling for evil
MarcGoodman_2012G_69 it's not just about terrorism though there's also been a big paradigm shift in crime you see 
MarcGoodman_2012G_70 you can now commit more crime as well in the old days it was a knife and a gun then criminals moved to robbing trains you could rob two hundred people on a train a great innovation
MarcGoodman_2012G_71 moving forward the internet allowed things to scale even more in fact many of you will remember the recent sony playstation hack
MarcGoodman_2012G_72 in that incident over one hundred million people were robbed 
MarcGoodman_2012G_75 of course it's not just about stealing things there are other avenues of technology that criminals can exploit many of you will remember this super cute
MarcGoodman_2012G_77 but not all quadcopter swarms are so nice and cute 
MarcGoodman_2012G_78 they don't all have drumsticks some can be armed with hd cameras and do countersurveillance on protesters 
MarcGoodman_2012G_83 of course criminals and terrorists weren't the first to give guns to robots we know where that started but they're adapting quickly recently the fbi arrested an al qaeda affiliate in the united states who was planning on using
MarcGoodman_2012G_85 every time a new technology is being introduced criminals are there to exploit it we've all seen 3d printers we know with them that you can print in many materials ranging from plastic to chocolate to metal and
MarcGoodman_2012G_86 with great precision i actually was able to make this just the other day a very cute little ducky 
MarcGoodman_2012G_90 if you can print in metal you can print one of these and in fact
MarcGoodman_2012G_91 you can also print one of these too
MarcGoodman_2012G_93 you needn't bring the gun into the uk anymore you just bring the 3d printer and print the gun while you're here and of course the magazines for your bullets 
MarcGoodman_2012G_99 criminals understand this terrorists understand
MarcGoodman_2012G_106 but if you don't need it and somebody else gives you the shock it's not a good thing
MarcGoodman_2012G_108 down to the cellular level these days up until this point all the technologies i've been talking about have been silicon based ones and zeroes 
MarcGoodman_2012G_109 but there's another operating system out there
MarcGoodman_2012G_113 hacking the software of life and while most of them are doing this to great good and to help us all some won't be
MarcGoodman_2012G_115 narcotics world
MarcGoodman_2012G_118 and cut and past that gene and put it into yeast and you can take those yeast and make them
MarcGoodman_2012G_119 make the cocaine for you or the marijuana
MarcGoodman_2012G_120 or any other drug so how we use yeast in the future is going to be really interesting in fact we may have some really interesting bread and
MarcGoodman_2012G_123 and now
MarcGoodman_2012G_128 enhanced versions of ebola or anthrax weaponized flu we recently saw a case where some researchers made the 
MarcGoodman_2012G_134 could see this and get access to this information 
MarcGoodman_2012G_136 one cell while leaving all the other cells around it intact then you can also go after any one person's cell
MarcGoodman_2012G_137 personalized cancer treatments are the flip side of personalized bioweapons which means you can attack any one individual
MarcGoodman_2012G_138 including all the people in this picture
MarcGoodman_2012G_140 what to do
MarcGoodman_2012G_141 what to do about all this that's what i get asked all the time for those of you who follow me on twitter i will be tweeting out the answer later on today laughter
MarcGoodman_2012G_142 actually it's a bit more complex than that and there are no magic bullets 
MarcGoodman_2012G_154 of helping our leaders or what if we sent it out to a few thousand
MarcGoodman_2012G_156 we've already seen examples of this working well the organized crime and corruption reporting project is staffed by journalists and citizens
MarcGoodman_2012G_157 dictators and terrorists are doing with public funds around the world and in a more dramatic case we've seen in mexico a country that has been racked by fifty thousand
MarcGoodman_2012G_162 whether or not you realize it we are at the dawn of a technological arms race an arms race between people who are using technology for good and those who are using it for ill
MarcGoodman_2012G_163 the threat is serious and the time to prepare for
MarcGoodman_2012G_166 're much better off having average and ordinary citizens approaching this problem as a group and seeing what we can
MarcGoodman_2012G_167 if we all do our part i think we'll be in a much better space
MarcGoodman_2012G_171 we've seen paradigm shifts in crime and terrorism they call for a shift
MarcGoodman_2012G_172 to a more open form and a more participatory form of law enforcement
MarcGoodman_2012G_173 so i invite you to join me after all public safety is too important to leave to the professionals thank you
