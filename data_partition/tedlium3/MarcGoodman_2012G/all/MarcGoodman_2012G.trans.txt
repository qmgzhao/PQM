MarcGoodman_2012G_0 i study
MarcGoodman_2012G_1 the future of crime and terrorism 
MarcGoodman_2012G_2 and frankly i'm afraid i'm afraid by what i see i sincerely
MarcGoodman_2012G_3 that we've been promised but you see i've spent a career in law enforcement
MarcGoodman_2012G_4 and that's informed my perspective on things i've been a street police officer an undercover investigator a counter terrorism strategist and i've worked in more than seventy countries around the world 
MarcGoodman_2012G_5 i've had to see more than my fair share of violence
MarcGoodman_2012G_6 and the darker underbelly of society and
MarcGoodman_2012G_7 's informed my opinions
MarcGoodman_2012G_8 my work with criminals and terrorists has actually been highly educational they have taught me a lot 
MarcGoodman_2012G_9 and i'd like to be able to share some of these observations with you
MarcGoodman_2012G_10 today i'm going to show you the flip side of all those technologies that we marvel at the ones
MarcGoodman_2012G_11 that we love in the hands of the ted community these are awesome tools which will bring about great change for our world 
MarcGoodman_2012G_12 but in the hands
MarcGoodman_2012G_13 of suicide bombers the future can look quite different i started observing
MarcGoodman_2012G_14 technology and how criminals were using it as a young patrol officer in those days this was the height of technology
MarcGoodman_2012G_15 though you will all the drug dealers and gang members with whom i dealt had one of these long before any police officer i knew did
MarcGoodman_2012G_16 twenty years later criminals are still using mobile phones 
MarcGoodman_2012G_17 but they're also building their own mobile phone networks like this one which has been deployed in all thirty one states of mexico by the narcos 
MarcGoodman_2012G_18 they have a national encrypted radio communications system
MarcGoodman_2012G_19 think about that think about the innovation that went into that think about the infrastructure to build it
MarcGoodman_2012G_20 and then think about this why can't i get a cell phone signal in san francisco
MarcGoodman_2012G_21 how is this possible it makes no sense
MarcGoodman_2012G_22 we consistently underestimate what criminals and terrorists can do
MarcGoodman_2012G_23 technology has made our world increasingly open and for the most part that's great but all of this openness may have unintended consequences 
MarcGoodman_2012G_24 consider the two thousand and eight terrorist attack on mumbai 
MarcGoodman_2012G_25 the men that carried that attack out were armed
MarcGoodman_2012G_26 explosives and hand grenades they threw these hand grenades at innocent people as they sat eating in cafes
MarcGoodman_2012G_27 and waited to catch trains on their way home from work 
MarcGoodman_2012G_28 but heavy artillery is nothing new in terrorist operations guns and bombs are nothing new
MarcGoodman_2012G_29 what was different this time is the way that the terrorists used modern information communications technologies to locate additional victims
MarcGoodman_2012G_30 and slaughter them they were armed with mobile phones
MarcGoodman_2012G_31 they had blackberries they had access to satellite imagery they had satellite phones and they even had night vision goggles 
MarcGoodman_2012G_32 but perhaps their greatest innovation was this 
MarcGoodman_2012G_33 we've all seen pictures like this on television and in the news
MarcGoodman_2012G_34 this is an operations center and the terrorists built their very own op center across the border in pakistan where they monitored the bbc al jazeera
MarcGoodman_2012G_35 jazeera cnn and indian local stations they also monitored the internet and social media
MarcGoodman_2012G_36 to monitor the progress of their attacks and how many people they had killed 
MarcGoodman_2012G_37 they did all of this in real time
MarcGoodman_2012G_38 the innovation of the terrorist operations center gave terrorists unparalleled situational awareness and tactical advantage over
MarcGoodman_2012G_39 the police
MarcGoodman_2012G_40 and over the government
MarcGoodman_2012G_41 what did they do with this they used it to great effect
MarcGoodman_2012G_42 at one point during the 60 hour siege the terrorists were going room to room trying to find additional victims
MarcGoodman_2012G_43 they came upon a suite on the top floor of the hotel and they kicked down the door and they found a man hiding by his bed and they
MarcGoodman_2012G_44 are you and what are you doing here and the man replied i'm just an innocent schoolteacher of course the terrorists knew
MarcGoodman_2012G_45 that no indian schoolteacher stays at a suite in the taj 
MarcGoodman_2012G_46 they picked up his identification and they phoned his name in to the terrorist war room
MarcGoodman_2012G_47 where the terrorist war room googled him and found a picture and called their operatives on the ground and said
MarcGoodman_2012G_48 your hostage is he heavyset
MarcGoodman_2012G_49 is he bald in front 
MarcGoodman_2012G_50 does he wear glasses
MarcGoodman_2012G_51 yes yes yes came the answers 
MarcGoodman_2012G_52 the op center had found him and they had a match he was not a schoolteacher he was the second wealthiest businessman in india 
MarcGoodman_2012G_53 and after discovering this information the terrorist war room
MarcGoodman_2012G_54 all worry about our privacy settings on facebook
MarcGoodman_2012G_55 but the fact of the matter is our openness can be used against us
MarcGoodman_2012G_56 terrorists are doing this a search engine
MarcGoodman_2012G_57 can determine who shall live and who shall die this is the world that we live in
MarcGoodman_2012G_58 during the mumbai siege terrorists were so dependent on technology that several witnesses reported that as the terrorists were shooting hostages with one hand
MarcGoodman_2012G_59 they were checking their mobile phone messages in the very other hand
MarcGoodman_2012G_60 in the end three hundred people were gravely wounded and over one hundred and
MarcGoodman_2012G_61 women and children lost their lives that day 
MarcGoodman_2012G_62 think about what happened during this 60 hour siege on mumbai ten
MarcGoodman_2012G_63 men armed not just with weapons but with technology were able to bring a city of twenty million people
MarcGoodman_2012G_64 to a standstill ten people brought twenty million people to a standstill and this traveled around the world this
MarcGoodman_2012G_65 this is what radicals can do with openness
MarcGoodman_2012G_66 this was done nearly four years ago what could terrorists do today with the technologies available that we have
MarcGoodman_2012G_67 what will they do tomorrow 
MarcGoodman_2012G_68 the ability of one to affect many is scaling exponentially and it's scaling for good and it's scaling for evil
MarcGoodman_2012G_69 it's not just about terrorism though there's also been a big paradigm shift in crime you see 
MarcGoodman_2012G_70 you can now commit more crime as well in the old days it was a knife and a gun then criminals moved to robbing trains you could rob two hundred people on a train a great innovation
MarcGoodman_2012G_71 moving forward the internet allowed things to scale even more in fact many of you will remember the recent sony playstation hack
MarcGoodman_2012G_72 in that incident over one hundred million people were robbed 
MarcGoodman_2012G_73 think about that
MarcGoodman_2012G_74 when in the history of humanity has it ever been possible for one person to rob one hundred million
MarcGoodman_2012G_75 of course it's not just about stealing things there are other avenues of technology that criminals can exploit many of you will remember this super cute
MarcGoodman_2012G_76 video from the last ted
MarcGoodman_2012G_77 but not all quadcopter swarms are so nice and cute 
MarcGoodman_2012G_78 they don't all have drumsticks some can be armed with hd cameras and do countersurveillance on protesters 
MarcGoodman_2012G_79 or as in this little bit of movie magic quadcopters can be loaded
MarcGoodman_2012G_80 with firearms
MarcGoodman_2012G_81 and automatic weapons
MarcGoodman_2012G_82 are cute when they play music to you when they swarm and chase you down the block to shoot you a little bit less so
MarcGoodman_2012G_83 of course criminals and terrorists weren't the first to give guns to robots we know where that started but they're adapting quickly recently the fbi arrested an al qaeda affiliate in the united states who was planning on using
MarcGoodman_2012G_84 drone aircraft to fly c4 explosives into government buildings in the united states by the way these travel at over six hundred miles an hour 
MarcGoodman_2012G_85 every time a new technology is being introduced criminals are there to exploit it we've all seen 3d printers we know with them that you can print in many materials ranging from plastic to chocolate to metal and
MarcGoodman_2012G_86 with great precision i actually was able to make this just the other day a very cute little ducky 
MarcGoodman_2012G_87 but i wonder to myself for those people that strap
MarcGoodman_2012G_88 bombs to their chests
MarcGoodman_2012G_89 and blow themselves up how might they use
MarcGoodman_2012G_90 if you can print in metal you can print one of these and in fact
MarcGoodman_2012G_91 you can also print one of these too
MarcGoodman_2012G_92 the uk i know has some very strict firearms
MarcGoodman_2012G_93 you needn't bring the gun into the uk anymore you just bring the 3d printer and print the gun while you're here and of course the magazines for your bullets 
MarcGoodman_2012G_94 but as these get bigger in the future what other items will you be able to print the technologies are allowing bigger printers 
MarcGoodman_2012G_95 as we move forward we'll see new technologies also like the internet of things every day we're connecting more and more of our lives
MarcGoodman_2012G_96 to the internet which means that the internet of things will soon be
MarcGoodman_2012G_97 the internet of things to be hacked all of the physical objects in our space are being transformed into information technologies and that has a radical implication for our security 
MarcGoodman_2012G_98 because more connections to more devices means more vulnerabilities
MarcGoodman_2012G_99 criminals understand this terrorists understand
MarcGoodman_2012G_100 hackers understand this if you control the code you control the world this is the future that awaits us
MarcGoodman_2012G_101 there has not yet been an operating system or a technology that hasn't been hacked
MarcGoodman_2012G_102 that's troubling since the human body itself
MarcGoodman_2012G_103 is now becoming an information technology as we've seen here we're transforming ourselves into cyborgs every year thousands
MarcGoodman_2012G_104 thousands of cochlear implants diabetic pumps pacemakers and defibrillators are being implanted in people in the united states there are sixty thousand people who have a pacemaker that connects to the internet
MarcGoodman_2012G_105 the defibrillators allow a physician at a distance to give a shock to a heart in case a patient needs it 
MarcGoodman_2012G_106 but if you don't need it and somebody else gives you the shock it's not a good thing
MarcGoodman_2012G_107 of course we're going to go even deeper than the human body
MarcGoodman_2012G_108 down to the cellular level these days up until this point all the technologies i've been talking about have been silicon based ones and zeroes 
MarcGoodman_2012G_109 but there's another operating system out there
MarcGoodman_2012G_110 the original operating system dna
MarcGoodman_2012G_111 and to hackers dna is just another operating system waiting to be hacked 
MarcGoodman_2012G_112 it's a great challenge for them there are people already working on
MarcGoodman_2012G_113 hacking the software of life and while most of them are doing this to great good and to help us all some won't be
MarcGoodman_2012G_114 so how will criminals abuse this well with synthetic biology you can do some pretty neat things for example i predict that we will move away from a 
MarcGoodman_2012G_115 narcotics world
MarcGoodman_2012G_116 why do you need the plants anymore you can just take the dna code from marijuana or poppies
MarcGoodman_2012G_117 or coca leaves
MarcGoodman_2012G_118 and cut and past that gene and put it into yeast and you can take those yeast and make them
MarcGoodman_2012G_119 make the cocaine for you or the marijuana
MarcGoodman_2012G_120 or any other drug so how we use yeast in the future is going to be really interesting in fact we may have some really interesting bread and
MarcGoodman_2012G_121 beer as we go into this next century
MarcGoodman_2012G_122 the cost of sequencing the human genome is dropping precipitously it was proceeding at moore's law pace but then in two thousand and eight something changed the technologies got better
MarcGoodman_2012G_123 and now
MarcGoodman_2012G_124 dna sequencing is proceeding at a pace five times that of moore's law that has significant implications for us
MarcGoodman_2012G_125 it took us thirty years to get from the introduction of the personal computer to the level of cybercrime we have today 
MarcGoodman_2012G_126 but looking at how biology is proceeding so rapidly and knowing criminals and terrorists as i do we may get there a lot faster with biocrime in the future it
MarcGoodman_2012G_127 will be easy for anybody to go ahead and print their own
MarcGoodman_2012G_128 enhanced versions of ebola or anthrax weaponized flu we recently saw a case where some researchers made the 
MarcGoodman_2012G_129 avian influenza virus more potent
MarcGoodman_2012G_130 it already has a seventy percent mortality rate if you get it but it's hard to get engineers by moving around a small number of genetic changes were able to weaponize 
MarcGoodman_2012G_131 it and make it much more easy for human beings to catch so that not thousands of people would die
MarcGoodman_2012G_132 but tens of millions you see you can
MarcGoodman_2012G_133 go ahead and create new pandemics and the researchers who did this were so proud of their accomplishments they wanted to publish it openly so that everybody
MarcGoodman_2012G_134 could see this and get access to this information 
MarcGoodman_2012G_135 but it goes deeper than that dna researcher andrew hessel has pointed out quite rightly that if you can use cancer treatments modern cancer treatments to go after one
MarcGoodman_2012G_136 one cell while leaving all the other cells around it intact then you can also go after any one person's cell
MarcGoodman_2012G_137 personalized cancer treatments are the flip side of personalized bioweapons which means you can attack any one individual
MarcGoodman_2012G_138 including all the people in this picture
MarcGoodman_2012G_139 how will we protect them in the future 
MarcGoodman_2012G_140 what to do
MarcGoodman_2012G_141 what to do about all this that's what i get asked all the time for those of you who follow me on twitter i will be tweeting out the answer later on today laughter
MarcGoodman_2012G_142 actually it's a bit more complex than that and there are no magic bullets 
MarcGoodman_2012G_143 i don't have all the answers but i know a few things in the wake of nine
MarcGoodman_2012G_144 the best security minds
MarcGoodman_2012G_145 put together all their innovation and this is what they created
MarcGoodman_2012G_146 for security if you're expecting the people who built this to protect you from the coming robopocalypse
MarcGoodman_2012G_147 while the threat is international
MarcGoodman_2012G_148 policing doesn't scale globally at least it hasn't and our current system of guns border guards big gates and fences are outdated in the new world into which we're moving
MarcGoodman_2012G_149 so how might we prepare for some of these specific threats like attacking a president or a prime minister this would be the natural government response to hide away all our government leaders in hermetically sealed bubbles
MarcGoodman_2012G_150 but this is not going to work the cost of doing a dna sequence is going to be trivial anybody will have it and we will all have them in the future
MarcGoodman_2012G_151 so maybe there's a more radical way that we can look at this 
MarcGoodman_2012G_152 what happens if we were to take the president's dna or a king or queen's
MarcGoodman_2012G_153 and put it out to a group of a few hundred trusted researchers so they could study that dna and do penetration testing against it as a
MarcGoodman_2012G_154 of helping our leaders or what if we sent it out to a few thousand
MarcGoodman_2012G_155 or controversially and not without its risks what happens if we just gave it to the whole public then we could all be engaged in helping
MarcGoodman_2012G_156 we've already seen examples of this working well the organized crime and corruption reporting project is staffed by journalists and citizens
MarcGoodman_2012G_157 dictators and terrorists are doing with public funds around the world and in a more dramatic case we've seen in mexico a country that has been racked by fifty thousand
MarcGoodman_2012G_158 murders in the past six years
MarcGoodman_2012G_159 they're killing so many people they can't even afford to bury them all in anything but these unmarked graves like this one outside of ciudad juarez
MarcGoodman_2012G_160 what can we do about this the government has proven ineffective so in
MarcGoodman_2012G_161 mexico citizens at great risk to themselves are fighting back to build an effective solution they're crowd mapping the activities of the drug dealers 
MarcGoodman_2012G_162 whether or not you realize it we are at the dawn of a technological arms race an arms race between people who are using technology for good and those who are using it for ill
MarcGoodman_2012G_163 the threat is serious and the time to prepare for
MarcGoodman_2012G_164 it is now i can assure you that the terrorists and criminals are
MarcGoodman_2012G_165 my personal belief is that rather than having a small elite force of highly trained government agents here to protect us all we
MarcGoodman_2012G_166 're much better off having average and ordinary citizens approaching this problem as a group and seeing what we can
MarcGoodman_2012G_167 if we all do our part i think we'll be in a much better space
MarcGoodman_2012G_168 the tools to change the world are in everybody's hands how we use them is not just up to me it's up to all of us
MarcGoodman_2012G_169 this was a technology i would frequently deploy as a police officer
MarcGoodman_2012G_170 this technology has become outdated in our current world it doesn't scale it doesn't work globally and it surely doesn't work virtually
MarcGoodman_2012G_171 we've seen paradigm shifts in crime and terrorism they call for a shift
MarcGoodman_2012G_172 to a more open form and a more participatory form of law enforcement
MarcGoodman_2012G_173 so i invite you to join me after all public safety is too important to leave to the professionals thank you
