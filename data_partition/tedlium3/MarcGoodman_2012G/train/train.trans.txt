MarcGoodman_2012G_0 i study
MarcGoodman_2012G_1 the future of crime and terrorism 
MarcGoodman_2012G_5 i've had to see more than my fair share of violence
MarcGoodman_2012G_6 and the darker underbelly of society and
MarcGoodman_2012G_7 's informed my opinions
MarcGoodman_2012G_8 my work with criminals and terrorists has actually been highly educational they have taught me a lot 
MarcGoodman_2012G_11 that we love in the hands of the ted community these are awesome tools which will bring about great change for our world 
MarcGoodman_2012G_15 though you will all the drug dealers and gang members with whom i dealt had one of these long before any police officer i knew did
MarcGoodman_2012G_16 twenty years later criminals are still using mobile phones 
MarcGoodman_2012G_17 but they're also building their own mobile phone networks like this one which has been deployed in all thirty one states of mexico by the narcos 
MarcGoodman_2012G_18 they have a national encrypted radio communications system
MarcGoodman_2012G_19 think about that think about the innovation that went into that think about the infrastructure to build it
MarcGoodman_2012G_21 how is this possible it makes no sense
MarcGoodman_2012G_24 consider the two thousand and eight terrorist attack on mumbai 
MarcGoodman_2012G_29 what was different this time is the way that the terrorists used modern information communications technologies to locate additional victims
MarcGoodman_2012G_32 but perhaps their greatest innovation was this 
MarcGoodman_2012G_36 to monitor the progress of their attacks and how many people they had killed 
MarcGoodman_2012G_41 what did they do with this they used it to great effect
MarcGoodman_2012G_42 at one point during the 60 hour siege the terrorists were going room to room trying to find additional victims
MarcGoodman_2012G_43 they came upon a suite on the top floor of the hotel and they kicked down the door and they found a man hiding by his bed and they
MarcGoodman_2012G_45 that no indian schoolteacher stays at a suite in the taj 
MarcGoodman_2012G_48 your hostage is he heavyset
MarcGoodman_2012G_53 and after discovering this information the terrorist war room
MarcGoodman_2012G_55 but the fact of the matter is our openness can be used against us
MarcGoodman_2012G_57 can determine who shall live and who shall die this is the world that we live in
MarcGoodman_2012G_59 they were checking their mobile phone messages in the very other hand
MarcGoodman_2012G_62 think about what happened during this 60 hour siege on mumbai ten
MarcGoodman_2012G_67 what will they do tomorrow 
MarcGoodman_2012G_73 think about that
MarcGoodman_2012G_74 when in the history of humanity has it ever been possible for one person to rob one hundred million
MarcGoodman_2012G_79 or as in this little bit of movie magic quadcopters can be loaded
MarcGoodman_2012G_80 with firearms
MarcGoodman_2012G_84 drone aircraft to fly c4 explosives into government buildings in the united states by the way these travel at over six hundred miles an hour 
MarcGoodman_2012G_87 but i wonder to myself for those people that strap
MarcGoodman_2012G_89 and blow themselves up how might they use
MarcGoodman_2012G_92 the uk i know has some very strict firearms
MarcGoodman_2012G_94 but as these get bigger in the future what other items will you be able to print the technologies are allowing bigger printers 
MarcGoodman_2012G_95 as we move forward we'll see new technologies also like the internet of things every day we're connecting more and more of our lives
MarcGoodman_2012G_96 to the internet which means that the internet of things will soon be
MarcGoodman_2012G_97 the internet of things to be hacked all of the physical objects in our space are being transformed into information technologies and that has a radical implication for our security 
MarcGoodman_2012G_100 hackers understand this if you control the code you control the world this is the future that awaits us
MarcGoodman_2012G_102 that's troubling since the human body itself
MarcGoodman_2012G_103 is now becoming an information technology as we've seen here we're transforming ourselves into cyborgs every year thousands
MarcGoodman_2012G_107 of course we're going to go even deeper than the human body
MarcGoodman_2012G_110 the original operating system dna
MarcGoodman_2012G_111 and to hackers dna is just another operating system waiting to be hacked 
MarcGoodman_2012G_112 it's a great challenge for them there are people already working on
MarcGoodman_2012G_114 so how will criminals abuse this well with synthetic biology you can do some pretty neat things for example i predict that we will move away from a 
MarcGoodman_2012G_117 or coca leaves
MarcGoodman_2012G_121 beer as we go into this next century
MarcGoodman_2012G_124 dna sequencing is proceeding at a pace five times that of moore's law that has significant implications for us
MarcGoodman_2012G_125 it took us thirty years to get from the introduction of the personal computer to the level of cybercrime we have today 
MarcGoodman_2012G_129 avian influenza virus more potent
MarcGoodman_2012G_130 it already has a seventy percent mortality rate if you get it but it's hard to get engineers by moving around a small number of genetic changes were able to weaponize 
MarcGoodman_2012G_131 it and make it much more easy for human beings to catch so that not thousands of people would die
MarcGoodman_2012G_132 but tens of millions you see you can
MarcGoodman_2012G_139 how will we protect them in the future 
MarcGoodman_2012G_143 i don't have all the answers but i know a few things in the wake of nine
MarcGoodman_2012G_144 the best security minds
MarcGoodman_2012G_145 put together all their innovation and this is what they created
MarcGoodman_2012G_146 for security if you're expecting the people who built this to protect you from the coming robopocalypse
MarcGoodman_2012G_147 while the threat is international
MarcGoodman_2012G_148 policing doesn't scale globally at least it hasn't and our current system of guns border guards big gates and fences are outdated in the new world into which we're moving
MarcGoodman_2012G_149 so how might we prepare for some of these specific threats like attacking a president or a prime minister this would be the natural government response to hide away all our government leaders in hermetically sealed bubbles
MarcGoodman_2012G_150 but this is not going to work the cost of doing a dna sequence is going to be trivial anybody will have it and we will all have them in the future
MarcGoodman_2012G_153 and put it out to a group of a few hundred trusted researchers so they could study that dna and do penetration testing against it as a
MarcGoodman_2012G_155 or controversially and not without its risks what happens if we just gave it to the whole public then we could all be engaged in helping
MarcGoodman_2012G_159 they're killing so many people they can't even afford to bury them all in anything but these unmarked graves like this one outside of ciudad juarez
MarcGoodman_2012G_165 my personal belief is that rather than having a small elite force of highly trained government agents here to protect us all we
MarcGoodman_2012G_170 this technology has become outdated in our current world it doesn't scale it doesn't work globally and it surely doesn't work virtually
