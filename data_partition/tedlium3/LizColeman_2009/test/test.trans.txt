LizColeman_2009_9 that for me was a voice i had not heard in decades a dream long forgotten
LizColeman_2009_12 but for me
LizColeman_2009_16 where they no longer provide
LizColeman_2009_25 the progression of today's college student is to jettison every interest except one
LizColeman_2009_26 and within that one to continually narrow the focus learning more and more about less and less
LizColeman_2009_27 this despite the evidence all around us of the interconnectedness of things

LizColeman_2009_37 either we have lost touch with those values or no better believe they need not or cannot be taught
LizColeman_2009_38 this aversion to social values may seem at odds with the explosion of community service programs but despite the attention paid to
LizColeman_2009_40 is treated as outside the realm of what purports to be serious thinking and adult purposes simply put
LizColeman_2009_43 than to create a sense of empowerment this brew
LizColeman_2009_44 oversimplification of civic engagement
LizColeman_2009_48 connections between education and the public good between intellectual integrity
LizColeman_2009_50 posed to and by

LizColeman_2009_70 who do believe in it actually understand it
LizColeman_2009_71 incredibly this nation
LizColeman_2009_72 with all its material intellectual and spiritual resources seems utterly helpless to reverse the freefall in any of these areas 
LizColeman_2009_73 equally startling from my point of view is the fact that no one
LizColeman_2009_77 you can be sure jefferson knew what he was talking about when he said
LizColeman_2009_81 impossible for me to avoid the question what will i say years from now when people ask' where were you'
LizColeman_2009_82 as president of a leading liberal arts college famous for its innovative history there were no excuses

LizColeman_2009_91 for trying and participating in finding them
LizColeman_2009_92 bennington would continue to teach the arts and sciences as areas of immersion that acknowledge differences in personal and professional objectives 
LizColeman_2009_94 redressed our shared purposes assume an equal if not greater importance
LizColeman_2009_103 and sustainable difference 
LizColeman_2009_104 contrary to widely held assumptions an emphasis on action provides a special urgency to thinking
LizColeman_2009_107 cannot tell them what they
LizColeman_2009_108 to know when the issue is rethinking education our approach to health or strategies for achieving an economics of equity 
LizColeman_2009_109 the value of the past also comes alive
LizColeman_2009_110 it provides a lot of company you are not the first to try to figure this out just as you are unlikely to be the last
LizColeman_2009_113 in the language of my students deep thought matters
LizColeman_2009_114 when you're contemplating what to do about things that matter a new liberal
LizColeman_2009_117 mediation and improvisation also assume a special place in this new pantheon 
LizColeman_2009_120 systematically between what is at the core and what is at the periphery 
LizColeman_2009_122 the more powerful our reach the more important the question about what
LizColeman_2009_123 when improvisation resourcefulness imagination are key artists at long last take their place at the table when strategies of action are in the process of being designed
LizColeman_2009_124 in this dramatically expanded ideal of a liberal arts education
LizColeman_2009_127 social activists business leaders lawyers politicians professionals will join the faculty as active and ongoing participants in this wedding of liberal education to the advancement of the public good

LizColeman_2009_144 the words on the card describe what will happen inside 
LizColeman_2009_146 to developing strategies for acting on the critical challenges of our time
LizColeman_2009_153 in being sidelined by the idea of the expert as the only one capable of coming up with answers
