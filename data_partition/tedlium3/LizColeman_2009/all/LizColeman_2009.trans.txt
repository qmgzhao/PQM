LizColeman_2009_0 college presidents are not the first people who come to mind
LizColeman_2009_1 when the subject is the uses of the creative imagination so i thought i'd start by telling you how i got here the story begins in the late'
LizColeman_2009_2 i was invited to meet with leading educators from the newly free eastern europe and russia
LizColeman_2009_3 they were trying to figure out how to rebuild their universities since education under the soviet union was essentially propaganda
LizColeman_2009_4 serving the purposes of a state ideology they appreciated that it would take wholesale transformations
LizColeman_2009_5 if they were to provide an education worthy of free men and women given this rare
LizColeman_2009_6 opportunity to start fresh they chose liberal arts as the most compelling model because of its historic commitment to furthering its students' broadest intellectual and deepest ethical potential
LizColeman_2009_7 having made that decision they came to the united states home of liberal arts education to talk with some of us most closely identified
LizColeman_2009_8 with that kind of education they spoke with a passion an urgency an intellectual conviction
LizColeman_2009_9 that for me was a voice i had not heard in decades a dream long forgotten
LizColeman_2009_10 for in truth we had moved light years
LizColeman_2009_11 from the passions that animated them 
LizColeman_2009_12 but for me
LizColeman_2009_13 unlike them in my world the slate was not clean and what was written
LizColeman_2009_14 on it was not encouraging in truth liberal arts education
LizColeman_2009_15 no longer exists at least genuine liberal arts education in this country we have professionalized liberal arts to the point
LizColeman_2009_16 where they no longer provide
LizColeman_2009_17 the breadth of application and the enhanced capacity for civic engagement
LizColeman_2009_18 that is their signature over the past century the expert has dethroned the educated generalist
LizColeman_2009_19 to become the sole model of intellectual accomplishment expertise
LizColeman_2009_20 has for sure had its moments but the price of its
LizColeman_2009_21 dominance is enormous
LizColeman_2009_22 subject matters are broken up into smaller and smaller pieces with increasing emphasis on the technical and the obscure 
LizColeman_2009_23 we have even managed to make the study of literature arcane
LizColeman_2009_24 you may think you know what is going on in that jane austen novel that is until your first encounter with postmodern deconstructionism
LizColeman_2009_25 the progression of today's college student is to jettison every interest except one
LizColeman_2009_26 and within that one to continually narrow the focus learning more and more about less and less
LizColeman_2009_27 this despite the evidence all around us of the interconnectedness of things 
LizColeman_2009_28 lest you think i exaggerate
LizColeman_2009_29 here are the beginnings of the a b cs of anthropology
LizColeman_2009_30 as one moves up the ladder values other than technical competence are viewed with increasing suspicion 
LizColeman_2009_31 questions such as what kind of a world are we making what kind of a world should we be making what kind of a world can we be making
LizColeman_2009_32 treated with more and more skepticism and move off the table in so doing
LizColeman_2009_33 the guardians of secular democracy in effect
LizColeman_2009_34 yield the connection between education and values to fundamentalists who you can be sure
LizColeman_2009_35 have no compunctions about using education to further their values the absolutes
LizColeman_2009_36 of a theocracy meanwhile the values and voices of democracy are silent 
LizColeman_2009_37 either we have lost touch with those values or no better believe they need not or cannot be taught
LizColeman_2009_38 this aversion to social values may seem at odds with the explosion of community service programs but despite the attention paid to
LizColeman_2009_39 these efforts they remain emphatically extracurricular in effect
LizColeman_2009_40 is treated as outside the realm of what purports to be serious thinking and adult purposes simply put
LizColeman_2009_41 when the impulse is to change the world
LizColeman_2009_42 the academy is more likely to engender a learned helplessness
LizColeman_2009_43 than to create a sense of empowerment this brew
LizColeman_2009_44 oversimplification of civic engagement
LizColeman_2009_45 idealization of the expert fragmentation of knowledge
LizColeman_2009_46 emphasis on technical mastery neutrality as a condition of academic integrity is toxic
LizColeman_2009_47 when it comes to pursuing the vital
LizColeman_2009_48 connections between education and the public good between intellectual integrity
LizColeman_2009_49 and human freedom which were at the heart of the challenge
LizColeman_2009_50 posed to and by
LizColeman_2009_51 my european colleagues when the astronomical distance between the realities of the academy and the visionary intensity of this challenge
LizColeman_2009_52 were more than enough i can assure you to give one pause
LizColeman_2009_53 what was happening outside higher education made backing off unthinkable 
LizColeman_2009_54 whether it was threats to the environment
LizColeman_2009_55 inequities in the distribution of wealth lack of a sane policy or a sustainable policy with respect to the continuing uses of energy we were in
LizColeman_2009_56 desperate straits and that was only the beginning
LizColeman_2009_57 the corrupting of our political life had become a living nightmare nothing was exempt
LizColeman_2009_58 separation of powers civil liberties 
LizColeman_2009_59 the rule of law the relationship of church and state accompanied by a squandering of the nation's material wealth
LizColeman_2009_60 that defied credulity
LizColeman_2009_61 a harrowing predilection for the uses of force had become commonplace with an equal distaste for the alternative forms of influence
LizColeman_2009_62 at the same time
LizColeman_2009_63 all of our firepower was impotent
LizColeman_2009_64 when it came to halting or even stemming the slaughter in rwanda
LizColeman_2009_65 once a model for the world
LizColeman_2009_66 has become most noteworthy for its failures 
LizColeman_2009_67 mastery of basic skills and a bare minimum of cultural literacy eludes vast numbers of our students 
LizColeman_2009_68 despite having a research establishment that is the envy of the world
LizColeman_2009_69 more than half of the american public don't believe in evolution and don't press your luck about how much those
LizColeman_2009_70 who do believe in it actually understand it
LizColeman_2009_71 incredibly this nation
LizColeman_2009_72 with all its material intellectual and spiritual resources seems utterly helpless to reverse the freefall in any of these areas 
LizColeman_2009_73 equally startling from my point of view is the fact that no one
LizColeman_2009_74 was drawing any connections between what is happening to the body politic and what is happening in our leading educational institutions 
LizColeman_2009_75 we may be at the top of the list when it comes to influencing access to personal wealth we are not even on the list
LizColeman_2009_76 when it comes to our responsibility for the health of this democracy we are playing with fire
LizColeman_2009_77 you can be sure jefferson knew what he was talking about when he said
LizColeman_2009_78 if a nation expects to be ignorant and free in a state of civilization it expects what never was
LizColeman_2009_79 and never will be
LizColeman_2009_80 on a more personal note this betrayal of our principles our decency our hope made it
LizColeman_2009_81 impossible for me to avoid the question what will i say years from now when people ask' where were you'
LizColeman_2009_82 as president of a leading liberal arts college famous for its innovative history there were no excuses 
LizColeman_2009_83 so the conversation began at bennington knowing that if we were to regain the integrity of liberal education it would take
LizColeman_2009_84 radical rethinking of basic assumptions beginning with our priorities 
LizColeman_2009_85 enhancing the public good becomes a primary objective
LizColeman_2009_86 the accomplishment of civic virtue is tied to the uses of intellect and imagination at their most challenging
LizColeman_2009_87 our ways of approaching agency and authority turn inside out
LizColeman_2009_88 to reflect
LizColeman_2009_89 the reality that no one has the answers to the challenges facing citizens in this century and everyone
LizColeman_2009_90 has the responsibility
LizColeman_2009_91 for trying and participating in finding them
LizColeman_2009_92 bennington would continue to teach the arts and sciences as areas of immersion that acknowledge differences in personal and professional objectives 
LizColeman_2009_93 but the balances
LizColeman_2009_94 redressed our shared purposes assume an equal if not greater importance
LizColeman_2009_95 when the design emerged it was surprisingly simple and straightforward 
LizColeman_2009_96 the idea is to make the 
LizColeman_2009_97 challenges themselves
LizColeman_2009_98 from health and education to the uses of force the organizers of the curriculum they would assume the commanding role of traditional disciplines
LizColeman_2009_99 but structures designed to connect rather than divide
LizColeman_2009_100 mutually dependent circles rather than isolating triangles
LizColeman_2009_101 and the point is not to treat these topics as topics of study but as frameworks of action
LizColeman_2009_102 the challenge to figure out what it will take to actually do something that makes a significant
LizColeman_2009_103 and sustainable difference 
LizColeman_2009_104 contrary to widely held assumptions an emphasis on action provides a special urgency to thinking
LizColeman_2009_105 the importance of coming to grips with values like justice
LizColeman_2009_106 equity truth becomes increasingly evident as students discover that interest alone
LizColeman_2009_107 cannot tell them what they
LizColeman_2009_108 to know when the issue is rethinking education our approach to health or strategies for achieving an economics of equity 
LizColeman_2009_109 the value of the past also comes alive
LizColeman_2009_110 it provides a lot of company you are not the first to try to figure this out just as you are unlikely to be the last
LizColeman_2009_111 even more valuable history
LizColeman_2009_112 provides a laboratory in which we see played out the actual as well as the intended consequences of ideas
LizColeman_2009_113 in the language of my students deep thought matters
LizColeman_2009_114 when you're contemplating what to do about things that matter a new liberal
LizColeman_2009_115 curriculum has begun to emerge rhetoric the art of organizing the world of words to maximum effect design 
LizColeman_2009_116 the art of organizing the world of things 
LizColeman_2009_117 mediation and improvisation also assume a special place in this new pantheon 
LizColeman_2009_118 quantitative reasoning attains its proper position at the heart of what it takes to manage change
LizColeman_2009_119 where measurement is crucial as is a capacity to discriminate
LizColeman_2009_120 systematically between what is at the core and what is at the periphery 
LizColeman_2009_121 and when making connections is of the essence the power of technology emerges with special intensity but so does the importance of content
LizColeman_2009_122 the more powerful our reach the more important the question about what
LizColeman_2009_123 when improvisation resourcefulness imagination are key artists at long last take their place at the table when strategies of action are in the process of being designed
LizColeman_2009_124 in this dramatically expanded ideal of a liberal arts education
LizColeman_2009_125 where the continuum of thought and action is its life's blood
LizColeman_2009_126 knowledge honed outside the academy becomes essential
LizColeman_2009_127 social activists business leaders lawyers politicians professionals will join the faculty as active and ongoing participants in this wedding of liberal education to the advancement of the public good
LizColeman_2009_128 in turn continuously move outside the classroom to engage the world directly
LizColeman_2009_129 and of course this new wine needs new bottles
LizColeman_2009_130 if we are to capture the liveliness and dynamism
LizColeman_2009_131 of this idea the most important discovery we made in our focus on public action
LizColeman_2009_132 was to appreciate that the hard choices are not between good and evil but between
LizColeman_2009_133 competing goods this discovery is transforming
LizColeman_2009_134 it undercuts 
LizColeman_2009_135 self righteousness radically alters the tone and character of controversy and enriches dramatically the possibilities for finding common ground
LizColeman_2009_136 ideology zealotry unsubstantiated opinions simply won't do
LizColeman_2009_137 this is a political education
LizColeman_2009_138 to be sure 
LizColeman_2009_139 but it is a politics of principle not of partisanship
LizColeman_2009_140 so the challenge for bennington is to do it on the cover of bennington's two thousand and eight holiday card
LizColeman_2009_141 is the architect's sketch of a building opening in two thousand and ten that is to be a center for the advancement of public action
LizColeman_2009_142 the center will embody and sustain this new
LizColeman_2009_143 educational commitment think of it as a kind of secular church
LizColeman_2009_144 the words on the card describe what will happen inside 
LizColeman_2009_145 we intend to turn the intellectual and imaginative power passion and boldness of our students faculty and staff
LizColeman_2009_146 to developing strategies for acting on the critical challenges of our time
LizColeman_2009_147 are doing our job 
LizColeman_2009_148 while these past weeks have been a time of national exhilaration in this country it would be tragic if you thought this meant your job was done 
LizColeman_2009_149 the glacial silence we have experienced in the face of the shredding of the constitution the unraveling of our public
LizColeman_2009_150 the deterioration of our infrastructure is not limited to the universities we the people
LizColeman_2009_151 have become inured to our own irrelevance when it comes to doing anything significant about anything that matters concerning governance beyond waiting another four years
LizColeman_2009_152 we persist also
LizColeman_2009_153 in being sidelined by the idea of the expert as the only one capable of coming up with answers
LizColeman_2009_154 despite the overwhelming evidence to the contrary the problem is there is no such thing
LizColeman_2009_155 as a viable democracy made up of experts
LizColeman_2009_156 and should continue to learn everything there is to know about something or other we actually do it all the time 
LizColeman_2009_157 and there will be and should be those who spend a lifetime pursuing a very highly defined area of inquiry but this 
LizColeman_2009_158 will not yield the flexibilities of mind
LizColeman_2009_159 the multiplicity of perspectives the capacities for collaboration and innovation this country needs that is where you come in
LizColeman_2009_160 what is certain
LizColeman_2009_161 is that the individual talent exhibited in such abundance here 
LizColeman_2009_162 needs to turn its attention to that collaborative messy frustrating contentious and impossible world of politics and public policy
LizColeman_2009_163 president obama and his team simply cannot do it alone
LizColeman_2009_164 if the question of where to start seems overwhelming you are at the beginning not the end of this adventure
LizColeman_2009_165 being overwhelmed is the first step
LizColeman_2009_166 if you are serious about trying to get at things that really matter on a scale that makes a difference so what do you do when you feel overwhelmed
LizColeman_2009_167 well you have two things you have a mind and you have other people start with those and change the world
