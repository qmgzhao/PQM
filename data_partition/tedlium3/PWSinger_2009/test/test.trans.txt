PWSinger_2009_0 i'd begin with a scene of war there was little to warn of the danger ahead the iraqi insurgent had placed
PWSinger_2009_1 the ied an improvised explosive device along the side of the road with great care by two
PWSinger_2009_2 thousand and six there were more than two thousand five hundred of these attacks every single month 
PWSinger_2009_4 the team that was hunting for this ied is called an eod team explosives ordinance disposaland they're the pointy end of the spear in the american effort to suppress these roadside bombs
PWSinger_2009_5 each eod team goes out on about six
PWSinger_2009_8 unfortunately this particular call would not end well by the time the soldier advanced close enough to see the telltale wires of the bomb it exploded in a
PWSinger_2009_12 it can cause death or injury you have to be as far as fifty yards away to escape that the blast is so strong it can even break your limbs even if you're not hit
PWSinger_2009_13 that soldier had been on top of the bomb 
PWSinger_2009_20 that scene sounds like science fiction but is battlefield reality already
PWSinger_2009_21 the soldier in that case was a 42 pound robot called a packbot 
PWSinger_2009_25 you the reality of robots used in war right now or already at the prototype stage it's just to give you a taste
PWSinger_2009_27 something big is going on in war today and maybe even the history of humanity itself the u s military went into iraq with a handful of drones in the air 
PWSinger_2009_28 we now have five thousand three hundred
PWSinger_2009_29 we went in with zero unmanned ground systems we now have twelve thousand and the tech term
PWSinger_2009_30 application takes on new meaning in this space 
PWSinger_2009_39 a robots revolution is upon us
PWSinger_2009_40 now i need to be clear here i'm not talking about a revolution where you have to worry about the governor of california showing up at your door
PWSinger_2009_42 like the invention of the atomic bomb but it may be even bigger than that because our unmanned systems don't just affect the how of war fighting
PWSinger_2009_43 they affect the who of fighting at its most fundamental level that is every previous revolution in war be it the machine gun be it the
PWSinger_2009_45 that's certainly the case with robotics but they also change the experience of the warrior and even the very identity of the warrior 
PWSinger_2009_47 monopoly on the fighting of war is breaking down in our very lifetime
PWSinger_2009_49 to the science fiction authors who inspired them to the 19 year old drone pilots who are fighting from nevada to the four star generals who command them to even the iraqi insurgents who they are targeting and what they think about our systems
PWSinger_2009_55 's the same thing in war the british and the french invented the tank 
PWSinger_2009_58 this raises a bigger worry for me
PWSinger_2009_59 how do we move forward in this
PWSinger_2009_63 so has warfare 
PWSinger_2009_70 but then the second is that we are going to see an expansion in the realm of terrorism
PWSinger_2009_74 i like these systems because they save
PWSinger_2009_75 but i worry about more marketization of wars more shock and awe talk to defray discussion of the costs
PWSinger_2009_77 robots for me take certain trends that are already in play in our body politic
PWSinger_2009_82 and so we may take those already lowering bars to war
PWSinger_2009_83 and drop them to the ground but
PWSinger_2009_91 weird world and so inevitably the ability to download these video clips to you know your ipod or your zune
PWSinger_2009_92 gives you
PWSinger_2009_93 the ability to turn it into entertainment
PWSinger_2009_94 soldiers have a name for these clips they call it war porn the typical one that i was sent was an email that had an attachment
PWSinger_2009_98 creates a wrinkle in the public's relationship with war i think about this with a sports
PWSinger_2009_101 these are just the clips these are just the espn sportscenter version of the game
PWSinger_2009_105 so one example of this that has big resonance in the policy realm is how this plays out on our very real war of ideas that we're fighting against radical
PWSinger_2009_106 groups what is the message that we think we are sending with these machines versus what is being received in terms of the message
PWSinger_2009_109 but when you go out and meet with people for example in lebanon it's a very different story one of the people i met with there was a news editor and we're talking as a drone is flying above him and this is 
PWSinger_2009_110 what he had to say this is just another sign of the coldhearted cruel israelis and americans who are cowards because they send out machines to fight us they don't want to fight us like real men but they're afraid to fight
PWSinger_2009_111 the future of war also is featuring a new type of warrior
PWSinger_2009_112 and it's actually redefining the experience of going to war you can call this a cubicle warrior this is what one predator drone pilot described of his experience fighting in the iraq war while never leaving nevada you
PWSinger_2009_113 're going to war for twelve hours shooting weapons at targets directing kills on enemy combatants
PWSinger_2009_114 and then you get in the car and you drive home and within twenty minutes you're sitting at the dinner table talking to your kids about their homework
PWSinger_2009_115 now the psychological balancing of those experiences is incredibly tough and in fact those drone pilots have higher rates of ptsd than many of the units physically in iraq 
PWSinger_2009_116 but some have worries that this disconnection will lead to something else that it might make the
PWSinger_2009_117 of war crimes a lot easier when you have this distance it's like a video game is what one young pilot described to me
PWSinger_2009_118 of taking out enemy troops from afar
PWSinger_2009_119 as anyone who's played grand theft auto knows we do things in the video world that we wouldn't do face to face
PWSinger_2009_123 the fog of war isn't being lifted the enemy has a vote we're gaining incredible new capabilities but we're also seeing and experiencing new human dilemmas
PWSinger_2009_124 now sometimes these are just oops moments which is what the head of a robotics company described it you just have
PWSinger_2009_127 where they tested out a machine gun armed robot and during the demonstration it started spinning in a circle and pointed its machine gun at the reviewing stand of
PWSinger_2009_131 we have new wrinkles in the laws of war and accountability what do we do with things like unmanned slaughter
PWSinger_2009_134 and this is where we're at right now this is not even talking about armed autonomous systems with full authority to use force
PWSinger_2009_142 and so we have this question to figure out
PWSinger_2009_145 i've talked about what seems the future of war but notice that i've only used real world examples and you've only seen real world pictures and videos 
PWSinger_2009_146 and so this sets a great challenge for all of us
PWSinger_2009_148 sounds like science fiction and therefore keeps us in denial
PWSinger_2009_150 and not deal
PWSinger_2009_154 then it's just a product recall issue
PWSinger_2009_157 the characters that represented the best and worst of humanity 
PWSinger_2009_158 only one character made it onto both lists 
PWSinger_2009_159 the terminator
PWSinger_2009_161 and so that points to the fact that our machines can be used for both good and evil but for me it points to the fact that there's a duality of humans as well 
PWSinger_2009_162 this week is a celebration of our creativity our creativity has taken our species to the stars our creativity has created works of arts and literature to express our love
