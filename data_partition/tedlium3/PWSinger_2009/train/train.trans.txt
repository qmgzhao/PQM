PWSinger_2009_3 and they were the leading cause of casualties among american soldiers and iraqi civilians
PWSinger_2009_6 hundred of these bomb calls every year
PWSinger_2009_7 defusing about two bombs a day perhaps the best sign of how valuable they are to the war effort is that the iraqi insurgents put a $ fifty thousand bounty on the head of a single eod soldier
PWSinger_2009_9 wave of flame 
PWSinger_2009_10 close you are and how much
PWSinger_2009_14 and so when the rest of the team advanced they found little left and that night the unit's commander did a sad duty 
PWSinger_2009_15 and he wrote a condolence letter back to the united states and he talked about how hard the loss had been on his unit about the fact that they had lost their
PWSinger_2009_16 soldier a soldier who had saved their lives many a time and he apologized
PWSinger_2009_17 for not being able to bring them home 
PWSinger_2009_22 the chief's letter went not to some farmhouse in iowa like you see in the old war movies but went to the irobot company 
PWSinger_2009_23 which is named after the asimov novel and the
PWSinger_2009_24 out carrying out mundane chores and then they started taking on life and death decisions that's a reality we face today what we're going to do is actually just flash a series of photos behind me that show 
PWSinger_2009_32 that's where we're at right now one of the people that i recently met with was an air force three star general and he said basically where we're headed very soon
PWSinger_2009_35 tens of thousands of today's robots but tens of thousands of these prototypes and tomorrow's robots because of course one of the things that's operating in technology is moore's law that 
PWSinger_2009_41 when historians look at this period they're going to conclude that we're in a different type of revolution a revolution in war
PWSinger_2009_46 another way of putting this is that mankind
PWSinger_2009_48 i've spent the last several years going around meeting with all the players in this field from the robot scientists
PWSinger_2009_50 and what i found interesting is not just their stories but how their experiences point to these ripple effects that are going outwards in our
PWSinger_2009_51 in our law and our ethics etc and so what i'd like to do with my remaining time is basically flesh out a couple of these
PWSinger_2009_53 the u s is currently ahead in military robotics right now 
PWSinger_2009_54 but we know that in technology there's no such thing as a permanent first move or advantage in a quick show of hands how many people
PWSinger_2009_57 and so what we have to think about for the u s is that we are ahead right now but you have forty three other countries out there working on military robotics and they include all the interesting countries like russia china pakistan iran and
PWSinger_2009_60 revolution given the state of our manufacturing and the state of our science and mathematics training in our schools
PWSinger_2009_61 or another way of thinking about this is what does it mean to go to war increasingly with soldiers whose hardware is made in china and software is written in india 
PWSinger_2009_62 but just as software has
PWSinger_2009_64 unlike an aircraft carrier or an atomic bomb you don't need a massive manufacturing system to build robotics a lot of it is off the shelf a lot of it's even do it yourself one of those things you just saw flashed 
PWSinger_2009_65 before you was a raven drone the handheld tossed one for about a thousand dollars you can build one yourself equivalent to what the soldiers use in iraq that raises another wrinkle when it comes to war and conflict
PWSinger_2009_67 during the war between israel a state and hezbollah a non state actor the non state actor flew four different drones against israel
PWSinger_2009_68 there's already a jihadi website that you can go on and remotely detonate an ied in iraq while sitting at your home computer
PWSinger_2009_69 and so i think what we're going to see is two trends take place with this first is you're going to reinforce the power of individuals against governments 
PWSinger_2009_73 but the ripple effects of this are going to go out into our politics one of the people that i met with was a former assistant secretary of defense for ronald reagan and he put it this way
PWSinger_2009_76 people are more likely to support the use of force if they view it as costless
PWSinger_2009_78 and maybe take them to their logical ending point we don't have a draft 
PWSinger_2009_79 we don't have
PWSinger_2009_80 declarations of war anymore we don't buy war bonds anymore 
PWSinger_2009_81 and now we have the fact that we're converting more and more of our american soldiers that we would send into harm's way into machines 
PWSinger_2009_85 that is our new technologies don't merely remove humans from risk they also record everything that they see
PWSinger_2009_86 so they don't just delink the public
PWSinger_2009_89 now this could be a good thing it could be building connections between the home front and the war front as never before
PWSinger_2009_90 but remember this is taking place in our
PWSinger_2009_96 bodies burst into the air with the explosion it was set to music it was set to the pop song i just want to fly by sugar ray 
PWSinger_2009_99 a professional basketball game on tv where the athletes are tiny figures on the screen
PWSinger_2009_103 now the irony of all this is that while the future of war may involve more and more machines it's our human psychology
PWSinger_2009_108 it plays to our strength the thing that scares people is our technology
PWSinger_2009_122 moore's law is operative but so's murphy's law
PWSinger_2009_125 are oops moments with robots in war well sometimes they're funny sometimes they're like that scene from the eddie murphy
PWSinger_2009_126 movie best defense playing out in reality
PWSinger_2009_128 fortunately the weapon wasn't loaded and no one was hurt 
PWSinger_2009_130 and actually did turn on and fired and nine soldiers were killed
PWSinger_2009_132 what is unmanned slaughter we've already had three instances of predator drone
PWSinger_2009_133 strikes where we thought we got bin laden and it turned out not to be the case
PWSinger_2009_137 and so you have this question what does this lead to issues like war crimes
PWSinger_2009_138 robots are emotionless so they don't get upset if their buddy is killed they don't commit crimes of rage and revenge 
PWSinger_2009_139 but robots are emotionless
PWSinger_2009_140 they see an 80 year old grandmother in a wheelchair the same way they see a t 80 tank 
PWSinger_2009_141 they're both just a series of zeroes and ones 
PWSinger_2009_143 how do we catch up our 20th century laws of war that are so old right now that they could qualify for medicare to these 21st century technologies 
PWSinger_2009_144 and so in conclusion
PWSinger_2009_149 are we going to face the reality of 21st century war is our generation going to make the same mistake that a past generation did with atomic weaponry
PWSinger_2009_151 the issues that surround it until pandora's box is already opened up
PWSinger_2009_152 now i could be wrong on this and one pentagon robot scientist told me that i was he said there's no real social ethical moral issues when it comes to robots
PWSinger_2009_155 and so the ending point for this is that actually we can turn to hollywood
PWSinger_2009_156 a few years ago hollywood gathered all the top characters and created a list of the top one hundred heroes and top one hundred villains of all of hollywood history
PWSinger_2009_160 a robot killing machine 
PWSinger_2009_163 and now we're using our creativity
PWSinger_2009_164 in a certain direction to build fantastic machines with incredible capabilities maybe even one day an entirely new species
PWSinger_2009_166 is because of our drive to destroy each other and so the question we all should ask is it our machines or is it us that's wired for war
