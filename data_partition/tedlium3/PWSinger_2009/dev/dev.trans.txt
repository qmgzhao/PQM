PWSinger_2009_11 explosive has been packed into that bomb 
PWSinger_2009_18 but then he talked up the silver lining that he took away from the loss
PWSinger_2009_19 at least as he wrote when a robot dies you don't have to write a letter to its mother
PWSinger_2009_26 anything that's powered by vulcan technology or teenage teenage wizard hormones or anything like that this is all real so why don't we go ahead and start those pictures
PWSinger_2009_31 and we need to remember that we're talking about the model t fords the wright flyers compared to what's coming soon
PWSinger_2009_33 is tens of thousands of robots operating in our conflicts and these numbers matter because we're not just talking
PWSinger_2009_34 about
PWSinger_2009_36 you can pack in more and more computing power into those robots and so flash forward around twenty five years if moore's law holds true those robots will be close to a billion times more powerful in their computing than today
PWSinger_2009_37 and so what that means is the kind of things that we used to only talk about at science fiction conventions like comic con
PWSinger_2009_38 have to be talked about in the halls of power and places like the pentagon
PWSinger_2009_44 was about a system that either shot faster went further had a bigger boom
PWSinger_2009_52 so the first is that the future of war even a robotics one is not going to be purely an american one
PWSinger_2009_56 the germans figured out how to use it right 
PWSinger_2009_66 this cross between robotics and things like terrorism is going to be fascinating and even disturbing and we've already seen it start 
PWSinger_2009_71 the future of it may be a cross between al qaeda two point zero and the next generation of the unabomber and another way of thinking about this is the fact that
PWSinger_2009_72 remember you don't have to convince a robot that they're gonna receive seventy two virgins after they die to convince them to blow themselves up 
PWSinger_2009_84 the future of war is also going to be a youtube war 
PWSinger_2009_87 they reshape its relationship with war 
PWSinger_2009_88 there's already several thousand video clips of combat footage from iraq on youtube right now most of it gathered by drones
PWSinger_2009_95 of video of a predator strike taking out an enemy site missile hits
PWSinger_2009_97 this ability to watch more but experience less
PWSinger_2009_100 and being at that basketball game in person and realizing what someone seven feet really does look like but we have to remember
PWSinger_2009_102 they lose the context they lose the strategy they lose the humanity war just becomes slam dunks and smart bombs 
PWSinger_2009_104 that's driving all of this it's our human failings that are leading to these wars 
PWSinger_2009_107 so one of the people that i met was a senior bush administration official who had this to say about our unmanning of war
PWSinger_2009_120 so much of what you're hearing from me is that there's another side to technologic revolutions
PWSinger_2009_121 shaping our present and maybe will shape our future of war 
PWSinger_2009_129 but other times oops moments are tragic such as last year in south africa where an anti aircraft cannon had a software glitch
PWSinger_2009_135 and do not believe that that isn't coming
PWSinger_2009_136 during my research i came across four different pentagon projects on different aspects of that 
PWSinger_2009_147 that we have to worry about well before you have to worry about your roomba sucking the life away from you are we going to let the fact that what's unveiling itself right now in war
PWSinger_2009_153 that is he added unless the machine kills the wrong people repeatedly
PWSinger_2009_165 but one of the main reasons that we're doing that
