PWSinger_2009_0 i'd begin with a scene of war there was little to warn of the danger ahead the iraqi insurgent had placed
PWSinger_2009_1 the ied an improvised explosive device along the side of the road with great care by two
PWSinger_2009_2 thousand and six there were more than two thousand five hundred of these attacks every single month 
PWSinger_2009_3 and they were the leading cause of casualties among american soldiers and iraqi civilians
PWSinger_2009_4 the team that was hunting for this ied is called an eod team explosives ordinance disposaland they're the pointy end of the spear in the american effort to suppress these roadside bombs
PWSinger_2009_5 each eod team goes out on about six
PWSinger_2009_6 hundred of these bomb calls every year
PWSinger_2009_7 defusing about two bombs a day perhaps the best sign of how valuable they are to the war effort is that the iraqi insurgents put a $ fifty thousand bounty on the head of a single eod soldier
PWSinger_2009_8 unfortunately this particular call would not end well by the time the soldier advanced close enough to see the telltale wires of the bomb it exploded in a
PWSinger_2009_9 wave of flame 
PWSinger_2009_10 close you are and how much
PWSinger_2009_11 explosive has been packed into that bomb 
PWSinger_2009_12 it can cause death or injury you have to be as far as fifty yards away to escape that the blast is so strong it can even break your limbs even if you're not hit
PWSinger_2009_13 that soldier had been on top of the bomb 
PWSinger_2009_14 and so when the rest of the team advanced they found little left and that night the unit's commander did a sad duty 
PWSinger_2009_15 and he wrote a condolence letter back to the united states and he talked about how hard the loss had been on his unit about the fact that they had lost their
PWSinger_2009_16 soldier a soldier who had saved their lives many a time and he apologized
PWSinger_2009_17 for not being able to bring them home 
PWSinger_2009_18 but then he talked up the silver lining that he took away from the loss
PWSinger_2009_19 at least as he wrote when a robot dies you don't have to write a letter to its mother
PWSinger_2009_20 that scene sounds like science fiction but is battlefield reality already
PWSinger_2009_21 the soldier in that case was a 42 pound robot called a packbot 
PWSinger_2009_22 the chief's letter went not to some farmhouse in iowa like you see in the old war movies but went to the irobot company 
PWSinger_2009_23 which is named after the asimov novel and the
PWSinger_2009_24 out carrying out mundane chores and then they started taking on life and death decisions that's a reality we face today what we're going to do is actually just flash a series of photos behind me that show 
PWSinger_2009_25 you the reality of robots used in war right now or already at the prototype stage it's just to give you a taste
PWSinger_2009_26 anything that's powered by vulcan technology or teenage teenage wizard hormones or anything like that this is all real so why don't we go ahead and start those pictures
PWSinger_2009_27 something big is going on in war today and maybe even the history of humanity itself the u s military went into iraq with a handful of drones in the air 
PWSinger_2009_28 we now have five thousand three hundred
PWSinger_2009_29 we went in with zero unmanned ground systems we now have twelve thousand and the tech term
PWSinger_2009_30 application takes on new meaning in this space 
PWSinger_2009_31 and we need to remember that we're talking about the model t fords the wright flyers compared to what's coming soon
PWSinger_2009_32 that's where we're at right now one of the people that i recently met with was an air force three star general and he said basically where we're headed very soon
PWSinger_2009_33 is tens of thousands of robots operating in our conflicts and these numbers matter because we're not just talking
PWSinger_2009_34 about
PWSinger_2009_35 tens of thousands of today's robots but tens of thousands of these prototypes and tomorrow's robots because of course one of the things that's operating in technology is moore's law that 
PWSinger_2009_36 you can pack in more and more computing power into those robots and so flash forward around twenty five years if moore's law holds true those robots will be close to a billion times more powerful in their computing than today
PWSinger_2009_37 and so what that means is the kind of things that we used to only talk about at science fiction conventions like comic con
PWSinger_2009_38 have to be talked about in the halls of power and places like the pentagon
PWSinger_2009_39 a robots revolution is upon us
PWSinger_2009_40 now i need to be clear here i'm not talking about a revolution where you have to worry about the governor of california showing up at your door
PWSinger_2009_41 when historians look at this period they're going to conclude that we're in a different type of revolution a revolution in war
PWSinger_2009_42 like the invention of the atomic bomb but it may be even bigger than that because our unmanned systems don't just affect the how of war fighting
PWSinger_2009_43 they affect the who of fighting at its most fundamental level that is every previous revolution in war be it the machine gun be it the
PWSinger_2009_44 was about a system that either shot faster went further had a bigger boom
PWSinger_2009_45 that's certainly the case with robotics but they also change the experience of the warrior and even the very identity of the warrior 
PWSinger_2009_46 another way of putting this is that mankind
PWSinger_2009_47 monopoly on the fighting of war is breaking down in our very lifetime
PWSinger_2009_48 i've spent the last several years going around meeting with all the players in this field from the robot scientists
PWSinger_2009_49 to the science fiction authors who inspired them to the 19 year old drone pilots who are fighting from nevada to the four star generals who command them to even the iraqi insurgents who they are targeting and what they think about our systems
PWSinger_2009_50 and what i found interesting is not just their stories but how their experiences point to these ripple effects that are going outwards in our
PWSinger_2009_51 in our law and our ethics etc and so what i'd like to do with my remaining time is basically flesh out a couple of these
PWSinger_2009_52 so the first is that the future of war even a robotics one is not going to be purely an american one
PWSinger_2009_53 the u s is currently ahead in military robotics right now 
PWSinger_2009_54 but we know that in technology there's no such thing as a permanent first move or advantage in a quick show of hands how many people
PWSinger_2009_55 's the same thing in war the british and the french invented the tank 
PWSinger_2009_56 the germans figured out how to use it right 
PWSinger_2009_57 and so what we have to think about for the u s is that we are ahead right now but you have forty three other countries out there working on military robotics and they include all the interesting countries like russia china pakistan iran and
PWSinger_2009_58 this raises a bigger worry for me
PWSinger_2009_59 how do we move forward in this
PWSinger_2009_60 revolution given the state of our manufacturing and the state of our science and mathematics training in our schools
PWSinger_2009_61 or another way of thinking about this is what does it mean to go to war increasingly with soldiers whose hardware is made in china and software is written in india 
PWSinger_2009_62 but just as software has
PWSinger_2009_63 so has warfare 
PWSinger_2009_64 unlike an aircraft carrier or an atomic bomb you don't need a massive manufacturing system to build robotics a lot of it is off the shelf a lot of it's even do it yourself one of those things you just saw flashed 
PWSinger_2009_65 before you was a raven drone the handheld tossed one for about a thousand dollars you can build one yourself equivalent to what the soldiers use in iraq that raises another wrinkle when it comes to war and conflict
PWSinger_2009_66 this cross between robotics and things like terrorism is going to be fascinating and even disturbing and we've already seen it start 
PWSinger_2009_67 during the war between israel a state and hezbollah a non state actor the non state actor flew four different drones against israel
PWSinger_2009_68 there's already a jihadi website that you can go on and remotely detonate an ied in iraq while sitting at your home computer
PWSinger_2009_69 and so i think what we're going to see is two trends take place with this first is you're going to reinforce the power of individuals against governments 
PWSinger_2009_70 but then the second is that we are going to see an expansion in the realm of terrorism
PWSinger_2009_71 the future of it may be a cross between al qaeda two point zero and the next generation of the unabomber and another way of thinking about this is the fact that
PWSinger_2009_72 remember you don't have to convince a robot that they're gonna receive seventy two virgins after they die to convince them to blow themselves up 
PWSinger_2009_73 but the ripple effects of this are going to go out into our politics one of the people that i met with was a former assistant secretary of defense for ronald reagan and he put it this way
PWSinger_2009_74 i like these systems because they save
PWSinger_2009_75 but i worry about more marketization of wars more shock and awe talk to defray discussion of the costs
PWSinger_2009_76 people are more likely to support the use of force if they view it as costless
PWSinger_2009_77 robots for me take certain trends that are already in play in our body politic
PWSinger_2009_78 and maybe take them to their logical ending point we don't have a draft 
PWSinger_2009_79 we don't have
PWSinger_2009_80 declarations of war anymore we don't buy war bonds anymore 
PWSinger_2009_81 and now we have the fact that we're converting more and more of our american soldiers that we would send into harm's way into machines 
PWSinger_2009_82 and so we may take those already lowering bars to war
PWSinger_2009_83 and drop them to the ground but
PWSinger_2009_84 the future of war is also going to be a youtube war 
PWSinger_2009_85 that is our new technologies don't merely remove humans from risk they also record everything that they see
PWSinger_2009_86 so they don't just delink the public
PWSinger_2009_87 they reshape its relationship with war 
PWSinger_2009_88 there's already several thousand video clips of combat footage from iraq on youtube right now most of it gathered by drones
PWSinger_2009_89 now this could be a good thing it could be building connections between the home front and the war front as never before
PWSinger_2009_90 but remember this is taking place in our
PWSinger_2009_91 weird world and so inevitably the ability to download these video clips to you know your ipod or your zune
PWSinger_2009_92 gives you
PWSinger_2009_93 the ability to turn it into entertainment
PWSinger_2009_94 soldiers have a name for these clips they call it war porn the typical one that i was sent was an email that had an attachment
PWSinger_2009_95 of video of a predator strike taking out an enemy site missile hits
PWSinger_2009_96 bodies burst into the air with the explosion it was set to music it was set to the pop song i just want to fly by sugar ray 
PWSinger_2009_97 this ability to watch more but experience less
PWSinger_2009_98 creates a wrinkle in the public's relationship with war i think about this with a sports
PWSinger_2009_99 a professional basketball game on tv where the athletes are tiny figures on the screen
PWSinger_2009_100 and being at that basketball game in person and realizing what someone seven feet really does look like but we have to remember
PWSinger_2009_101 these are just the clips these are just the espn sportscenter version of the game
PWSinger_2009_102 they lose the context they lose the strategy they lose the humanity war just becomes slam dunks and smart bombs 
PWSinger_2009_103 now the irony of all this is that while the future of war may involve more and more machines it's our human psychology
PWSinger_2009_104 that's driving all of this it's our human failings that are leading to these wars 
PWSinger_2009_105 so one example of this that has big resonance in the policy realm is how this plays out on our very real war of ideas that we're fighting against radical
PWSinger_2009_106 groups what is the message that we think we are sending with these machines versus what is being received in terms of the message
PWSinger_2009_107 so one of the people that i met was a senior bush administration official who had this to say about our unmanning of war
PWSinger_2009_108 it plays to our strength the thing that scares people is our technology
PWSinger_2009_109 but when you go out and meet with people for example in lebanon it's a very different story one of the people i met with there was a news editor and we're talking as a drone is flying above him and this is 
PWSinger_2009_110 what he had to say this is just another sign of the coldhearted cruel israelis and americans who are cowards because they send out machines to fight us they don't want to fight us like real men but they're afraid to fight
PWSinger_2009_111 the future of war also is featuring a new type of warrior
PWSinger_2009_112 and it's actually redefining the experience of going to war you can call this a cubicle warrior this is what one predator drone pilot described of his experience fighting in the iraq war while never leaving nevada you
PWSinger_2009_113 're going to war for twelve hours shooting weapons at targets directing kills on enemy combatants
PWSinger_2009_114 and then you get in the car and you drive home and within twenty minutes you're sitting at the dinner table talking to your kids about their homework
PWSinger_2009_115 now the psychological balancing of those experiences is incredibly tough and in fact those drone pilots have higher rates of ptsd than many of the units physically in iraq 
PWSinger_2009_116 but some have worries that this disconnection will lead to something else that it might make the
PWSinger_2009_117 of war crimes a lot easier when you have this distance it's like a video game is what one young pilot described to me
PWSinger_2009_118 of taking out enemy troops from afar
PWSinger_2009_119 as anyone who's played grand theft auto knows we do things in the video world that we wouldn't do face to face
PWSinger_2009_120 so much of what you're hearing from me is that there's another side to technologic revolutions
PWSinger_2009_121 shaping our present and maybe will shape our future of war 
PWSinger_2009_122 moore's law is operative but so's murphy's law
PWSinger_2009_123 the fog of war isn't being lifted the enemy has a vote we're gaining incredible new capabilities but we're also seeing and experiencing new human dilemmas
PWSinger_2009_124 now sometimes these are just oops moments which is what the head of a robotics company described it you just have
PWSinger_2009_125 are oops moments with robots in war well sometimes they're funny sometimes they're like that scene from the eddie murphy
PWSinger_2009_126 movie best defense playing out in reality
PWSinger_2009_127 where they tested out a machine gun armed robot and during the demonstration it started spinning in a circle and pointed its machine gun at the reviewing stand of
PWSinger_2009_128 fortunately the weapon wasn't loaded and no one was hurt 
PWSinger_2009_129 but other times oops moments are tragic such as last year in south africa where an anti aircraft cannon had a software glitch
PWSinger_2009_130 and actually did turn on and fired and nine soldiers were killed
PWSinger_2009_131 we have new wrinkles in the laws of war and accountability what do we do with things like unmanned slaughter
PWSinger_2009_132 what is unmanned slaughter we've already had three instances of predator drone
PWSinger_2009_133 strikes where we thought we got bin laden and it turned out not to be the case
PWSinger_2009_134 and this is where we're at right now this is not even talking about armed autonomous systems with full authority to use force
PWSinger_2009_135 and do not believe that that isn't coming
PWSinger_2009_136 during my research i came across four different pentagon projects on different aspects of that 
PWSinger_2009_137 and so you have this question what does this lead to issues like war crimes
PWSinger_2009_138 robots are emotionless so they don't get upset if their buddy is killed they don't commit crimes of rage and revenge 
PWSinger_2009_139 but robots are emotionless
PWSinger_2009_140 they see an 80 year old grandmother in a wheelchair the same way they see a t 80 tank 
PWSinger_2009_141 they're both just a series of zeroes and ones 
PWSinger_2009_142 and so we have this question to figure out
PWSinger_2009_143 how do we catch up our 20th century laws of war that are so old right now that they could qualify for medicare to these 21st century technologies 
PWSinger_2009_144 and so in conclusion
PWSinger_2009_145 i've talked about what seems the future of war but notice that i've only used real world examples and you've only seen real world pictures and videos 
PWSinger_2009_146 and so this sets a great challenge for all of us
PWSinger_2009_147 that we have to worry about well before you have to worry about your roomba sucking the life away from you are we going to let the fact that what's unveiling itself right now in war
PWSinger_2009_148 sounds like science fiction and therefore keeps us in denial
PWSinger_2009_149 are we going to face the reality of 21st century war is our generation going to make the same mistake that a past generation did with atomic weaponry
PWSinger_2009_150 and not deal
PWSinger_2009_151 the issues that surround it until pandora's box is already opened up
PWSinger_2009_152 now i could be wrong on this and one pentagon robot scientist told me that i was he said there's no real social ethical moral issues when it comes to robots
PWSinger_2009_153 that is he added unless the machine kills the wrong people repeatedly
PWSinger_2009_154 then it's just a product recall issue
PWSinger_2009_155 and so the ending point for this is that actually we can turn to hollywood
PWSinger_2009_156 a few years ago hollywood gathered all the top characters and created a list of the top one hundred heroes and top one hundred villains of all of hollywood history
PWSinger_2009_157 the characters that represented the best and worst of humanity 
PWSinger_2009_158 only one character made it onto both lists 
PWSinger_2009_159 the terminator
PWSinger_2009_160 a robot killing machine 
PWSinger_2009_161 and so that points to the fact that our machines can be used for both good and evil but for me it points to the fact that there's a duality of humans as well 
PWSinger_2009_162 this week is a celebration of our creativity our creativity has taken our species to the stars our creativity has created works of arts and literature to express our love 
PWSinger_2009_163 and now we're using our creativity
PWSinger_2009_164 in a certain direction to build fantastic machines with incredible capabilities maybe even one day an entirely new species
PWSinger_2009_165 but one of the main reasons that we're doing that
PWSinger_2009_166 is because of our drive to destroy each other and so the question we all should ask is it our machines or is it us that's wired for war
