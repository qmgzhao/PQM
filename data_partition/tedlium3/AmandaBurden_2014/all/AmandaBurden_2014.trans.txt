AmandaBurden_2014_0 when people think about cities they tend to think of certain things they think of buildings and streets and skyscrapers noisy cabs 
AmandaBurden_2014_1 but when i think about cities i think about
AmandaBurden_2014_2 fundamentally about people and where people go and where people meet are at the core of what makes a city work 
AmandaBurden_2014_3 so even more important than buildings in a city
AmandaBurden_2014_4 are the public spaces in between them 
AmandaBurden_2014_5 and today some of the most transformative changes in cities are happening in these public spaces 
AmandaBurden_2014_6 so
AmandaBurden_2014_7 i believe that lively enjoyable public spaces are the key to planning a great city they are what makes it come alive 
AmandaBurden_2014_8 but what makes a public space work
AmandaBurden_2014_9 what attracts people to successful public spaces and what is it about unsuccessful places that keeps people away 
AmandaBurden_2014_10 i thought if i could answer those questions i could make a huge contribution to my city
AmandaBurden_2014_11 but one of the more wonky things about me is that i am an animal behaviorist 
AmandaBurden_2014_12 and i use those skills not to study animal behavior but to study how people in cities use city public spaces
AmandaBurden_2014_13 one of the first spaces that i studied
AmandaBurden_2014_14 was this little vest pocket park called paley park in midtown manhattan this little space became
AmandaBurden_2014_15 a small phenomenon
AmandaBurden_2014_16 and because it had such a profound impact on new yorkers it made an enormous impression on me
AmandaBurden_2014_17 i studied this park very early on in my career because it happened to have been built by my stepfather so i knew that places like paley park didn't happen
AmandaBurden_2014_18 i saw firsthand that they required incredible dedication and enormous attention to detail 
AmandaBurden_2014_19 but what was it about this space that made it special and drew people to it
AmandaBurden_2014_20 well i would sit in the park and watch very carefully and first among other things were the comfortable movable chairs
AmandaBurden_2014_21 people would come in find their own seat move
AmandaBurden_2014_22 and then stay a while and then interestingly people themselves attracted other people
AmandaBurden_2014_23 and ironically i felt more peaceful if there were other people around 
AmandaBurden_2014_24 and it was green this little park provided what new yorkers crave comfort and greenery 
AmandaBurden_2014_25 but my question was why weren't there more places with greenery and places to sit in the middle of the city where you didn't feel alone
AmandaBurden_2014_26 or like a trespasser 
AmandaBurden_2014_27 unfortunately that's not how cities were being designed
AmandaBurden_2014_28 so here you see a familiar sight
AmandaBurden_2014_29 this is how plazas have been designed for generations they have that stylish spartan look that we often associate
AmandaBurden_2014_30 it's not surprising that people avoid spaces like this they not only look desolate they feel downright dangerous 
AmandaBurden_2014_31 i mean where would you sit here
AmandaBurden_2014_32 what would you do here 
AmandaBurden_2014_33 but
AmandaBurden_2014_34 architects love them they are plinths for their creations they might tolerate a sculpture
AmandaBurden_2014_35 but that's about it
AmandaBurden_2014_36 and for developers they are ideal there's nothing to water nothing to maintain and no undesirable people to worry about
AmandaBurden_2014_37 but don't you think this is a waste
AmandaBurden_2014_38 for me becoming a city planner meant being able to truly change the city that i lived in and loved 
AmandaBurden_2014_39 i wanted to be able to create places that
AmandaBurden_2014_40 would give you the feeling that you got in paley park and not
AmandaBurden_2014_41 developers to build bleak plazas like this
AmandaBurden_2014_42 but over the many years i have learned how hard it is to create successful meaningful enjoyable public spaces 
AmandaBurden_2014_43 as i learned from my stepfather they certainly do not happen by accident 
AmandaBurden_2014_44 especially in a city like new york where public space has
AmandaBurden_2014_45 to be fought for to begin with and then for them to be successful somebody has to think very hard about every detail 
AmandaBurden_2014_46 now open spaces in cities are opportunities yes they are opportunities for commercial investment
AmandaBurden_2014_47 but they are also opportunities for the common good of the city
AmandaBurden_2014_48 and those two goals are often not aligned with one another and therein lies the conflict the first opportunity i had to fight
AmandaBurden_2014_49 for a great public open space was in the early 1980s when i was leading a team of planners at a gigantic landfill called battery park city in lower manhattan on the hudson river
AmandaBurden_2014_50 and this sandy wasteland had lain barren for ten years and we were told unless we found a developer in six months it would go bankrupt 
AmandaBurden_2014_51 so we came up with a radical almost insane idea
AmandaBurden_2014_52 instead of building a park as a complement to future development why don't we reverse that equation
AmandaBurden_2014_53 and build a small but very high quality public open space first and see if that made a difference
AmandaBurden_2014_54 so we only could afford to build a two block section of what would become a mile long esplanade
AmandaBurden_2014_55 so whatever we built had to be perfect
AmandaBurden_2014_56 just to make sure i insisted that we build a mock up in wood at scale of the railing and the sea wall 
AmandaBurden_2014_57 and when i sat down on that test bench with sand still swirling all around me
AmandaBurden_2014_58 the railing hit exactly at eye level blocking my view and ruining my experience at the water's edge 
AmandaBurden_2014_59 so you see
AmandaBurden_2014_60 do make a difference but design is not just how something looks it's how your body feels on that seat
AmandaBurden_2014_61 in that space and i believe that successful design always depends on that very individual experience
AmandaBurden_2014_62 in this photo 
AmandaBurden_2014_63 everything looks very finished but that granite edge
AmandaBurden_2014_64 the back on that bench the trees in planting and the many different kinds of places to sit were all little battles that turned this project into a place that people wanted to be
AmandaBurden_2014_65 now this proved very valuable twenty years later
AmandaBurden_2014_66 when michael bloomberg asked me to be his planning commissioner and put me in charge of shaping the entire city of new york
AmandaBurden_2014_67 he said to me on that very day he said that new york was projected to grow from eight to nine million people and he asked me
AmandaBurden_2014_68 so where are you going to put one million additional new yorkers
AmandaBurden_2014_69 well i didn't have any idea
AmandaBurden_2014_70 now you know that new york does place a high value on attracting immigrants so we were excited about the prospect of growth but
AmandaBurden_2014_71 honestly where were we going to grow in a city that was already built out to its edges and surrounded by water
AmandaBurden_2014_72 how were we going to find housing for that many new new yorkers 
AmandaBurden_2014_73 and if we couldn't spread out which was probably a good thing where could new housing go
AmandaBurden_2014_74 and what about cars our city couldn't possibly handle any more cars
AmandaBurden_2014_75 what were we going to do
AmandaBurden_2014_76 if we couldn't spread out we had to go up
AmandaBurden_2014_77 and if we had to go up we had to go up in places where you wouldn't need to own a car so that meant using one of our greatest assets
AmandaBurden_2014_78 our transit system but we had never before thought of how we could make the most of it
AmandaBurden_2014_79 so here was the answer to our puzzle 
AmandaBurden_2014_80 if we were to
AmandaBurden_2014_81 channel and redirect all new development around transit we could actually handle that population increase we thought 
AmandaBurden_2014_82 and so here was the plan what we really needed to do we needed to redo our zoning
AmandaBurden_2014_83 and zoning is the city planner's regulatory tool and basically reshape the entire city targeting where new development could go
AmandaBurden_2014_84 and prohibiting any development at all in our 
AmandaBurden_2014_85 suburban style neighborhoods well this was an unbelievably ambitious idea ambitious
AmandaBurden_2014_86 because communities had to approve those plans so how was i going to get this done by listening
AmandaBurden_2014_87 i began listening in fact thousands of hours of listening
AmandaBurden_2014_88 just to establish trust you know communities can tell whether or not you understand their neighborhoods it's not something you can just fake 
AmandaBurden_2014_89 and so
AmandaBurden_2014_90 i began walking i can't tell you how many blocks i walked in sweltering summers in freezing winters
AmandaBurden_2014_91 year after year just so i could get to understand the dna of each neighborhood and know what
AmandaBurden_2014_92 each street felt like i became an incredibly geeky zoning expert finding ways that zoning could address communities' concerns 
AmandaBurden_2014_93 so little by little neighborhood by neighborhood block by block we began to set height limits so that all new development would be predictable and near transit
AmandaBurden_2014_94 over the course of twelve years we were able to rezone
AmandaBurden_2014_95 hundred and twenty four neighborhoods forty percent of the city 
AmandaBurden_2014_96 twelve thousand five hundred blocks so that now ninety percent of all new development of new york is within a 10 minute walk of a subway
AmandaBurden_2014_97 in other words nobody in those new buildings needs to own a car
AmandaBurden_2014_98 and important but rezoning was never my mission
AmandaBurden_2014_99 you can't see zoning and you can't feel zoning my mission was always to create great public spaces 
AmandaBurden_2014_100 so in the areas where we zoned for significant development i was determined to create places that would make a difference in people's
AmandaBurden_2014_101 here you see what was two miles of abandoned degraded waterfront in the neighborhoods of greenpoint and williamsburg in brooklyn
AmandaBurden_2014_102 impossible to get to and impossible to use
AmandaBurden_2014_103 now the zoning here was massive so i felt an obligation
AmandaBurden_2014_104 to create magnificent parks on these waterfronts and i spent an incredible amount of time on every square inch of these plans 
AmandaBurden_2014_105 i wanted to make sure that there were
AmandaBurden_2014_106 from the upland to the water that there were trees and plantings everywhere and of course lots and lots of places to sit
AmandaBurden_2014_107 honestly i had no idea how it would turn out i had to have faith 
AmandaBurden_2014_108 but i put everything that i had studied and learned into those plans 
AmandaBurden_2014_109 and then it opened and i have to tell you it was incredible people came from all over the city to
AmandaBurden_2014_110 be in these parks i know they changed the lives of the people who live there but they also changed new yorkers' whole image of their city 
AmandaBurden_2014_111 i often come down and watch people get on this little ferry that now runs between the boroughs 
AmandaBurden_2014_112 and i can't tell you why but i'm completely moved by the fact that people are using it as if it had always been there
AmandaBurden_2014_113 and here is a new park in lower manhattan
AmandaBurden_2014_114 now the water's edge in lower manhattan was a complete mess before nine eleven
AmandaBurden_2014_115 wall street was essentially landlocked because you couldn't get anywhere near this edge 
AmandaBurden_2014_116 and after nine eleven the city had very little control 
AmandaBurden_2014_117 but i thought if we went to the lower manhattan development corporation and got money to reclaim this two miles of degraded waterfront
AmandaBurden_2014_118 that it would have an enormous effect on the
AmandaBurden_2014_119 of lower manhattan and it did lower manhattan finally has a public waterfront on all three sides
AmandaBurden_2014_120 i really love this park
AmandaBurden_2014_121 you know railings have to be higher now so we put bar seating at the edge 
AmandaBurden_2014_122 and you can get so close to the water you're practically on it and see how the railing widens and flattens out so you can lay down your lunch or your laptop
AmandaBurden_2014_123 and i love when people come there and look up and they say wow there's brooklyn and it's so close
AmandaBurden_2014_124 so what's the trick how do you turn a park
AmandaBurden_2014_125 into a place that people want to be well it's up to you not as a city planner but as a human
AmandaBurden_2014_126 you don't tap into your design expertise you tap into your humanity 
AmandaBurden_2014_127 i mean
AmandaBurden_2014_128 would you want to go there would you want to stay there can you see into it and out of it are there other people there
AmandaBurden_2014_129 does it seem green and friendly can you find your very own seat 
AmandaBurden_2014_130 well now all over new york city there are places where you can find your very own seat
AmandaBurden_2014_131 where there used to be parking spaces there are now pop up cafes
AmandaBurden_2014_132 where broadway traffic used to run there are now tables and chairs 
AmandaBurden_2014_133 where twelve years ago sidewalk cafes were not allowed they are now everywhere 
AmandaBurden_2014_134 but claiming these spaces for public use was not simple and it's even harder to keep them
AmandaBurden_2014_135 so now i'm going to tell you a story about a very unusual park
AmandaBurden_2014_136 called the high line 
AmandaBurden_2014_137 the high line was an elevated railway applause
AmandaBurden_2014_138 the high line was an elevated railway that ran through three neighborhoods on manhattan's west side 
AmandaBurden_2014_139 and when the train stopped running it became a self seeded
AmandaBurden_2014_140 a kind of a garden in the sky and when i saw it the first time 
AmandaBurden_2014_141 honestly when i went up on that old viaduct i fell in love the way you fall in love with a person honestly 
AmandaBurden_2014_142 and when i was appointed saving the first two sections of the high line from demolition became my first priority and my most important project
AmandaBurden_2014_143 i knew if there was a day that i
AmandaBurden_2014_144 worry about the high line it would come down
AmandaBurden_2014_145 and the high line even though it is widely known now and phenomenally popular it is the most contested public space in the city 
AmandaBurden_2014_146 you might see a beautiful park 
AmandaBurden_2014_147 but not everyone does
AmandaBurden_2014_148 you know it's true commercial interests will always battle against public space 
AmandaBurden_2014_149 how wonderful it is that more than four million people come from all over the world to visit the high line
AmandaBurden_2014_150 well a developer sees just one thing customers hey why not take out those plantings and have shops all along the high line wouldn't that be terrific and won't it mean a lot more money for the city 
AmandaBurden_2014_151 well no it would not be terrific it would be a mall
AmandaBurden_2014_152 it might mean more money for the city but a city has to take the long view the view for the common good
AmandaBurden_2014_153 most recently 
AmandaBurden_2014_154 the last section of the high line the third section of the high line the final section of the high line has been pitted against development interests
AmandaBurden_2014_155 where some of the city's leading developers are building more than seventeen million square feet at the hudson yards
AmandaBurden_2014_156 and they came to me and proposed that they temporarily disassemble that third and final section
AmandaBurden_2014_157 perhaps the high line didn't fit in with their image of a gleaming city of skyscrapers on a
AmandaBurden_2014_158 perhaps it was just in their way
AmandaBurden_2014_159 but in any case it took nine months of nonstop daily negotiation to finally get the signed agreement to prohibit its demolition and that was only two years ago 
AmandaBurden_2014_160 so you see no matter how popular and successful a public space may be it can never be taken for granted public
AmandaBurden_2014_161 always this is it saved public spaces always need vigilant champions
AmandaBurden_2014_162 not only to claim them at the outset for public use but to design them for the people that use them
AmandaBurden_2014_163 then to maintain them to ensure that they are for everyone that they are not violated invaded abandoned or ignored
AmandaBurden_2014_164 if there is any one lesson that i have learned in my life as a city planner it is that public spaces have power
AmandaBurden_2014_165 it's not just the number of people using them it's the even greater number of people who feel better about their city just knowing that they are there
AmandaBurden_2014_166 public space can change how you live in a city how you feel about a city whether you choose one city over another 
AmandaBurden_2014_167 and public space is one of the most important reasons why you stay in a city
AmandaBurden_2014_168 i believe that a successful city is like a fabulous party
AmandaBurden_2014_169 people stay because they are having a great time thank you
