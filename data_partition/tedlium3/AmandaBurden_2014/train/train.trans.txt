AmandaBurden_2014_1 but when i think about cities i think about
AmandaBurden_2014_2 fundamentally about people and where people go and where people meet are at the core of what makes a city work 
AmandaBurden_2014_3 so even more important than buildings in a city
AmandaBurden_2014_5 and today some of the most transformative changes in cities are happening in these public spaces 
AmandaBurden_2014_7 i believe that lively enjoyable public spaces are the key to planning a great city they are what makes it come alive 
AmandaBurden_2014_13 one of the first spaces that i studied
AmandaBurden_2014_14 was this little vest pocket park called paley park in midtown manhattan this little space became
AmandaBurden_2014_18 i saw firsthand that they required incredible dedication and enormous attention to detail 
AmandaBurden_2014_19 but what was it about this space that made it special and drew people to it
AmandaBurden_2014_21 people would come in find their own seat move
AmandaBurden_2014_24 and it was green this little park provided what new yorkers crave comfort and greenery 
AmandaBurden_2014_28 so here you see a familiar sight
AmandaBurden_2014_34 architects love them they are plinths for their creations they might tolerate a sculpture
AmandaBurden_2014_39 i wanted to be able to create places that
AmandaBurden_2014_40 would give you the feeling that you got in paley park and not
AmandaBurden_2014_42 but over the many years i have learned how hard it is to create successful meaningful enjoyable public spaces 
AmandaBurden_2014_44 especially in a city like new york where public space has
AmandaBurden_2014_47 but they are also opportunities for the common good of the city
AmandaBurden_2014_51 so we came up with a radical almost insane idea
AmandaBurden_2014_52 instead of building a park as a complement to future development why don't we reverse that equation
AmandaBurden_2014_54 so we only could afford to build a two block section of what would become a mile long esplanade
AmandaBurden_2014_62 in this photo 
AmandaBurden_2014_64 the back on that bench the trees in planting and the many different kinds of places to sit were all little battles that turned this project into a place that people wanted to be
AmandaBurden_2014_66 when michael bloomberg asked me to be his planning commissioner and put me in charge of shaping the entire city of new york
AmandaBurden_2014_68 so where are you going to put one million additional new yorkers
AmandaBurden_2014_72 how were we going to find housing for that many new new yorkers 
AmandaBurden_2014_73 and if we couldn't spread out which was probably a good thing where could new housing go
AmandaBurden_2014_75 what were we going to do
AmandaBurden_2014_77 and if we had to go up we had to go up in places where you wouldn't need to own a car so that meant using one of our greatest assets
AmandaBurden_2014_81 channel and redirect all new development around transit we could actually handle that population increase we thought 
AmandaBurden_2014_84 and prohibiting any development at all in our 
AmandaBurden_2014_87 i began listening in fact thousands of hours of listening
AmandaBurden_2014_90 i began walking i can't tell you how many blocks i walked in sweltering summers in freezing winters
AmandaBurden_2014_91 year after year just so i could get to understand the dna of each neighborhood and know what
AmandaBurden_2014_92 each street felt like i became an incredibly geeky zoning expert finding ways that zoning could address communities' concerns 
AmandaBurden_2014_93 so little by little neighborhood by neighborhood block by block we began to set height limits so that all new development would be predictable and near transit
AmandaBurden_2014_96 twelve thousand five hundred blocks so that now ninety percent of all new development of new york is within a 10 minute walk of a subway
AmandaBurden_2014_97 in other words nobody in those new buildings needs to own a car
AmandaBurden_2014_100 so in the areas where we zoned for significant development i was determined to create places that would make a difference in people's
AmandaBurden_2014_103 now the zoning here was massive so i felt an obligation
AmandaBurden_2014_106 from the upland to the water that there were trees and plantings everywhere and of course lots and lots of places to sit
AmandaBurden_2014_107 honestly i had no idea how it would turn out i had to have faith 
AmandaBurden_2014_109 and then it opened and i have to tell you it was incredible people came from all over the city to
AmandaBurden_2014_112 and i can't tell you why but i'm completely moved by the fact that people are using it as if it had always been there
AmandaBurden_2014_113 and here is a new park in lower manhattan
AmandaBurden_2014_116 and after nine eleven the city had very little control 
AmandaBurden_2014_117 but i thought if we went to the lower manhattan development corporation and got money to reclaim this two miles of degraded waterfront
AmandaBurden_2014_124 so what's the trick how do you turn a park
AmandaBurden_2014_125 into a place that people want to be well it's up to you not as a city planner but as a human
AmandaBurden_2014_126 you don't tap into your design expertise you tap into your humanity 
AmandaBurden_2014_131 where there used to be parking spaces there are now pop up cafes
AmandaBurden_2014_133 where twelve years ago sidewalk cafes were not allowed they are now everywhere 
AmandaBurden_2014_135 so now i'm going to tell you a story about a very unusual park
AmandaBurden_2014_136 called the high line 
AmandaBurden_2014_138 the high line was an elevated railway that ran through three neighborhoods on manhattan's west side 
AmandaBurden_2014_143 i knew if there was a day that i
AmandaBurden_2014_144 worry about the high line it would come down
AmandaBurden_2014_146 you might see a beautiful park 
AmandaBurden_2014_148 you know it's true commercial interests will always battle against public space 
AmandaBurden_2014_149 how wonderful it is that more than four million people come from all over the world to visit the high line
AmandaBurden_2014_150 well a developer sees just one thing customers hey why not take out those plantings and have shops all along the high line wouldn't that be terrific and won't it mean a lot more money for the city 
AmandaBurden_2014_156 and they came to me and proposed that they temporarily disassemble that third and final section
AmandaBurden_2014_157 perhaps the high line didn't fit in with their image of a gleaming city of skyscrapers on a
AmandaBurden_2014_161 always this is it saved public spaces always need vigilant champions
AmandaBurden_2014_164 if there is any one lesson that i have learned in my life as a city planner it is that public spaces have power
AmandaBurden_2014_165 it's not just the number of people using them it's the even greater number of people who feel better about their city just knowing that they are there
AmandaBurden_2014_166 public space can change how you live in a city how you feel about a city whether you choose one city over another 
AmandaBurden_2014_167 and public space is one of the most important reasons why you stay in a city
