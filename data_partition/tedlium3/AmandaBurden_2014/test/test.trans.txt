AmandaBurden_2014_0 when people think about cities they tend to think of certain things they think of buildings and streets and skyscrapers noisy cabs 
AmandaBurden_2014_4 are the public spaces in between them 
AmandaBurden_2014_6 so
AmandaBurden_2014_9 what attracts people to successful public spaces and what is it about unsuccessful places that keeps people away 
AmandaBurden_2014_10 i thought if i could answer those questions i could make a huge contribution to my city
AmandaBurden_2014_11 but one of the more wonky things about me is that i am an animal behaviorist 
AmandaBurden_2014_16 and because it had such a profound impact on new yorkers it made an enormous impression on me
AmandaBurden_2014_17 i studied this park very early on in my career because it happened to have been built by my stepfather so i knew that places like paley park didn't happen
AmandaBurden_2014_20 well i would sit in the park and watch very carefully and first among other things were the comfortable movable chairs
AmandaBurden_2014_23 and ironically i felt more peaceful if there were other people around 
AmandaBurden_2014_25 but my question was why weren't there more places with greenery and places to sit in the middle of the city where you didn't feel alone
AmandaBurden_2014_27 unfortunately that's not how cities were being designed
AmandaBurden_2014_29 this is how plazas have been designed for generations they have that stylish spartan look that we often associate
AmandaBurden_2014_30 it's not surprising that people avoid spaces like this they not only look desolate they feel downright dangerous 
AmandaBurden_2014_31 i mean where would you sit here
AmandaBurden_2014_32 what would you do here 
AmandaBurden_2014_35 but that's about it
AmandaBurden_2014_37 but don't you think this is a waste
AmandaBurden_2014_41 developers to build bleak plazas like this
AmandaBurden_2014_46 now open spaces in cities are opportunities yes they are opportunities for commercial investment
AmandaBurden_2014_49 for a great public open space was in the early 1980s when i was leading a team of planners at a gigantic landfill called battery park city in lower manhattan on the hudson river
AmandaBurden_2014_50 and this sandy wasteland had lain barren for ten years and we were told unless we found a developer in six months it would go bankrupt 
AmandaBurden_2014_55 so whatever we built had to be perfect
AmandaBurden_2014_56 just to make sure i insisted that we build a mock up in wood at scale of the railing and the sea wall 
AmandaBurden_2014_57 and when i sat down on that test bench with sand still swirling all around me
AmandaBurden_2014_58 the railing hit exactly at eye level blocking my view and ruining my experience at the water's edge 
AmandaBurden_2014_59 so you see
AmandaBurden_2014_60 do make a difference but design is not just how something looks it's how your body feels on that seat
AmandaBurden_2014_61 in that space and i believe that successful design always depends on that very individual experience
AmandaBurden_2014_65 now this proved very valuable twenty years later
AmandaBurden_2014_69 well i didn't have any idea
AmandaBurden_2014_71 honestly where were we going to grow in a city that was already built out to its edges and surrounded by water
AmandaBurden_2014_74 and what about cars our city couldn't possibly handle any more cars
AmandaBurden_2014_79 so here was the answer to our puzzle 
AmandaBurden_2014_82 and so here was the plan what we really needed to do we needed to redo our zoning
AmandaBurden_2014_83 and zoning is the city planner's regulatory tool and basically reshape the entire city targeting where new development could go
AmandaBurden_2014_85 suburban style neighborhoods well this was an unbelievably ambitious idea ambitious
AmandaBurden_2014_86 because communities had to approve those plans so how was i going to get this done by listening
AmandaBurden_2014_89 and so
AmandaBurden_2014_94 over the course of twelve years we were able to rezone
AmandaBurden_2014_95 hundred and twenty four neighborhoods forty percent of the city 
AmandaBurden_2014_98 and important but rezoning was never my mission
AmandaBurden_2014_99 you can't see zoning and you can't feel zoning my mission was always to create great public spaces 
AmandaBurden_2014_102 impossible to get to and impossible to use
AmandaBurden_2014_105 i wanted to make sure that there were
AmandaBurden_2014_108 but i put everything that i had studied and learned into those plans 
AmandaBurden_2014_110 be in these parks i know they changed the lives of the people who live there but they also changed new yorkers' whole image of their city 
AmandaBurden_2014_111 i often come down and watch people get on this little ferry that now runs between the boroughs 
AmandaBurden_2014_114 now the water's edge in lower manhattan was a complete mess before nine eleven
AmandaBurden_2014_118 that it would have an enormous effect on the
AmandaBurden_2014_119 of lower manhattan and it did lower manhattan finally has a public waterfront on all three sides
AmandaBurden_2014_121 you know railings have to be higher now so we put bar seating at the edge 
AmandaBurden_2014_123 and i love when people come there and look up and they say wow there's brooklyn and it's so close
AmandaBurden_2014_128 would you want to go there would you want to stay there can you see into it and out of it are there other people there
AmandaBurden_2014_129 does it seem green and friendly can you find your very own seat 
AmandaBurden_2014_139 and when the train stopped running it became a self seeded
AmandaBurden_2014_141 honestly when i went up on that old viaduct i fell in love the way you fall in love with a person honestly 
AmandaBurden_2014_142 and when i was appointed saving the first two sections of the high line from demolition became my first priority and my most important project
AmandaBurden_2014_145 and the high line even though it is widely known now and phenomenally popular it is the most contested public space in the city 
AmandaBurden_2014_147 but not everyone does
AmandaBurden_2014_151 well no it would not be terrific it would be a mall
AmandaBurden_2014_152 it might mean more money for the city but a city has to take the long view the view for the common good
AmandaBurden_2014_153 most recently 
AmandaBurden_2014_158 perhaps it was just in their way
AmandaBurden_2014_162 not only to claim them at the outset for public use but to design them for the people that use them
AmandaBurden_2014_163 then to maintain them to ensure that they are for everyone that they are not violated invaded abandoned or ignored
AmandaBurden_2014_168 i believe that a successful city is like a fabulous party
AmandaBurden_2014_169 people stay because they are having a great time thank you
