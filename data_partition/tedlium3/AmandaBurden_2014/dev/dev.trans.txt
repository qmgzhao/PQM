AmandaBurden_2014_8 but what makes a public space work
AmandaBurden_2014_12 and i use those skills not to study animal behavior but to study how people in cities use city public spaces
AmandaBurden_2014_15 a small phenomenon
AmandaBurden_2014_22 and then stay a while and then interestingly people themselves attracted other people
AmandaBurden_2014_26 or like a trespasser 
AmandaBurden_2014_33 but
AmandaBurden_2014_36 and for developers they are ideal there's nothing to water nothing to maintain and no undesirable people to worry about
AmandaBurden_2014_38 for me becoming a city planner meant being able to truly change the city that i lived in and loved 
AmandaBurden_2014_43 as i learned from my stepfather they certainly do not happen by accident 
AmandaBurden_2014_45 to be fought for to begin with and then for them to be successful somebody has to think very hard about every detail 
AmandaBurden_2014_48 and those two goals are often not aligned with one another and therein lies the conflict the first opportunity i had to fight
AmandaBurden_2014_53 and build a small but very high quality public open space first and see if that made a difference
AmandaBurden_2014_63 everything looks very finished but that granite edge
AmandaBurden_2014_67 he said to me on that very day he said that new york was projected to grow from eight to nine million people and he asked me
AmandaBurden_2014_70 now you know that new york does place a high value on attracting immigrants so we were excited about the prospect of growth but
AmandaBurden_2014_76 if we couldn't spread out we had to go up
AmandaBurden_2014_78 our transit system but we had never before thought of how we could make the most of it
AmandaBurden_2014_80 if we were to
AmandaBurden_2014_88 just to establish trust you know communities can tell whether or not you understand their neighborhoods it's not something you can just fake 
AmandaBurden_2014_101 here you see what was two miles of abandoned degraded waterfront in the neighborhoods of greenpoint and williamsburg in brooklyn
AmandaBurden_2014_104 to create magnificent parks on these waterfronts and i spent an incredible amount of time on every square inch of these plans 
AmandaBurden_2014_115 wall street was essentially landlocked because you couldn't get anywhere near this edge 
AmandaBurden_2014_120 i really love this park
AmandaBurden_2014_122 and you can get so close to the water you're practically on it and see how the railing widens and flattens out so you can lay down your lunch or your laptop
AmandaBurden_2014_127 i mean
AmandaBurden_2014_130 well now all over new york city there are places where you can find your very own seat
AmandaBurden_2014_132 where broadway traffic used to run there are now tables and chairs 
AmandaBurden_2014_134 but claiming these spaces for public use was not simple and it's even harder to keep them
AmandaBurden_2014_137 the high line was an elevated railway applause
AmandaBurden_2014_140 a kind of a garden in the sky and when i saw it the first time 
AmandaBurden_2014_154 the last section of the high line the third section of the high line the final section of the high line has been pitted against development interests
AmandaBurden_2014_155 where some of the city's leading developers are building more than seventeen million square feet at the hudson yards
AmandaBurden_2014_159 but in any case it took nine months of nonstop daily negotiation to finally get the signed agreement to prohibit its demolition and that was only two years ago 
AmandaBurden_2014_160 so you see no matter how popular and successful a public space may be it can never be taken for granted public
