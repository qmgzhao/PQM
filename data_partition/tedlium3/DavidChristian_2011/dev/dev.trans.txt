DavidChristian_2011_9 to lack of order lack of structure in fact to mush and that's why that video feels a bit strange and yet 
DavidChristian_2011_11 what we see around us is staggering complexity eric beinhocker estimates that in new york city alone there are some ten billion
DavidChristian_2011_12 skus or distinct commodities being traded
DavidChristian_2011_17 in pockets there appear what my colleague fred spier calls
DavidChristian_2011_25 and that's the story that we tell in big history but to do it you have do something that may at first sight seem completely impossible you have to survey the whole history of the universe 
DavidChristian_2011_28 around us
DavidChristian_2011_36 and energy does something else quite magical it congeals to form matter
DavidChristian_2011_47 are about a thousandth of a degree cooler than the red areas these are tiny differences but it was enough for the universe to move on to the next stage of building complexity and this is how it works 
DavidChristian_2011_50 as density increases the temperature begins to rise at the center of each cloud and then at the center the temperature crosses the threshold temperature of ten million degrees protons start to fuse there's a huge release of
DavidChristian_2011_56 that protons begin to fuse in all sorts of exotic combinations to form all the elements of the periodic table if like me you're wearing a gold ring it was forged in a supernova explosion 
DavidChristian_2011_57 so now the universe is chemically more complex and in a chemically more complex universe it's possible to make more things
DavidChristian_2011_61 rocky planets like our earth are significantly more complex than stars because they contain a much greater diversity of materials so we've crossed a fourth threshold of complexity 
DavidChristian_2011_65 i'm talking of course about living organisms
DavidChristian_2011_74 but not too close
DavidChristian_2011_78 and link up to form molecules now where do you find such goldilocks conditions
DavidChristian_2011_81 you've got heat seeping up from inside the earth and you've got a great diversity of elements so at those deep oceanic vents 
DavidChristian_2011_88 thing that carries information and you allow the template to copy itself and dna of course is the beautiful molecule that contains that information you
DavidChristian_2011_97 and occasionally there are disasters
DavidChristian_2011_98 million years ago an asteroid landed on earth near the yucatan peninsula creating conditions equivalent to those of a nuclear
DavidChristian_2011_103 humans appeared about two hundred thousand years ago and i believe we count
DavidChristian_2011_104 as a threshold in this great story let me explain why
DavidChristian_2011_107 but dna had actually generated a faster way of learning it had produced organisms with brains and those organisms can learn
DavidChristian_2011_116 we evolved as a species in the savanna lands of africa 
DavidChristian_2011_117 but then you see humans migrating into new environments into desert lands into jungles into the ice age tundra of siberia tough tough environment into the americas into australasia
DavidChristian_2011_124 global brain of almost seven billion individuals and that brain is learning at warp speed 
DavidChristian_2011_125 collective learning together explain the staggering complexity we see around us 
DavidChristian_2011_127 here we are
DavidChristian_2011_141 that they understand both the challenges that face us and the opportunities that face us
DavidChristian_2011_143 we believe that big history will be a vital intellectual tool for them as daniel
