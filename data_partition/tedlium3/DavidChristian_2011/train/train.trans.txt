DavidChristian_2011_3 and you'll now see the yolk and the white have separated and now they're going to be poured back into the egg and we all know in our heart of hearts that this is not the way the universe works
DavidChristian_2011_4 a scrambled egg is mush tasty mush but it's mush an egg is a beautiful sophisticated thing that can create even more sophisticated things such as chickens 
DavidChristian_2011_6 in fact this gut instinct is reflected in one of the most fundamental laws of physics the second law of thermodynamics or the law of
DavidChristian_2011_13 that's hundreds of times as many species as there are on earth 
DavidChristian_2011_14 and they're being traded by a species of almost seven billion individuals who are linked by trade travel and the internet into a global system of stupendous complexity 
DavidChristian_2011_15 a universe ruled by the second law of thermodynamics how is it possible to generate the sort of complexity i've described the sort of complexity represented by you and me and the convention center 
DavidChristian_2011_16 well the answer seems to be the universe can create complexity but with great difficulty
DavidChristian_2011_19 and slightly more complex things appear and where you have slightly more complex things you can get slightly more complex things and in this way complexity builds stage by stage
DavidChristian_2011_24 as extremely complex creatures desperately need to know this story of how the universe creates complexity despite the second law and why complexity means vulnerability and fragility
DavidChristian_2011_26 do it
DavidChristian_2011_27 let's begin by winding the timeline back thirteen point seven billion years to the beginning of time
DavidChristian_2011_29 emptiest thing you can
DavidChristian_2011_30 and cube it a gazillion times and that's where we are and then suddenly
DavidChristian_2011_35 within the first second energy itself shatters into distinct forces including electromagnetism and gravity
DavidChristian_2011_40 that's twice as long as humans have been on this planet and now simple atoms appear of hydrogen and helium
DavidChristian_2011_41 now i want to pause for a moment three hundred and eighty thousand years after the origins of the universe
DavidChristian_2011_46 the blue areas
DavidChristian_2011_51 we have our first stars
DavidChristian_2011_52 from about two hundred million years after the big bang stars begin to appear all through the universe billions of them 
DavidChristian_2011_53 and the universe is now significantly more interesting and more complex
DavidChristian_2011_59 all these elements combine they swirl around the energy of the star stirs them around they form particles they form snowflakes they form little dust motes they form 
DavidChristian_2011_60 rocks they form asteroids and eventually they form planets and moons and that is how our solar system was formed four and a half billion
DavidChristian_2011_62 now
DavidChristian_2011_64 the next stage introduces entities that are significantly more fragile significantly more vulnerable but they're also much more creative and much more capable of generating further complexity
DavidChristian_2011_67 so chemistry is dominated by the electromagnetic force that operates over smaller scales than gravity which explains why you and i are smaller than stars or planets
DavidChristian_2011_68 now what are the ideal conditions for chemistry
DavidChristian_2011_71 but not too much in the center of a star there's so much energy that any atoms that combine will just get busted apart again but not too little
DavidChristian_2011_72 in intergalactic space there's so little energy that atoms can't combine 
DavidChristian_2011_73 what you want is just the right amount and planets it turns out are just right because they're close to stars
DavidChristian_2011_76 well in gases atoms move past each other so fast that they can't hitch up
DavidChristian_2011_77 in solids atoms are stuck together they can't move in liquids they can cruise and cuddle
DavidChristian_2011_80 it was just the right distance from its star to contain huge oceans of liquid water and deep beneath those oceans at cracks in the earth's crust
DavidChristian_2011_82 fantastic chemistry began to happen
DavidChristian_2011_83 atoms combined in all sorts of exotic combinations 
DavidChristian_2011_84 but of course life is more than just exotic chemistry
DavidChristian_2011_85 how do you stabilize those huge molecules that seem to be viable well
DavidChristian_2011_86 it's here that life introduces an entirely new trick
DavidChristian_2011_89 'll be familiar with the double helix of dna each rung contains information so dna contains information about how to make living organisms
DavidChristian_2011_91 the real beauty of dna though is in its imperfections as it copies itself once in every billion rungs there tends to be an error and what that means
DavidChristian_2011_92 is that dna is in effect learning it's accumulating new ways of making living organisms because some of those errors work
DavidChristian_2011_94 for most of that time of life on earth living organisms have been relatively simple single cells but they had great diversity and inside great complexity 
DavidChristian_2011_99 and the dinosaurs were wiped out
DavidChristian_2011_101 but great news for our mammalian ancestors who flourished in the niches left empty by the dinosaurs and we human beings 
DavidChristian_2011_102 are part of that creative evolutionary pulse that began sixty five million years ago with the landing of an asteroid
DavidChristian_2011_106 dna accumulates information through random errors some of which just happen to work 
DavidChristian_2011_109 now what makes humans different
DavidChristian_2011_110 is human language 
DavidChristian_2011_113 we seem to be the only species in four billion years to have this gift
DavidChristian_2011_114 i call this ability collective learning it's what makes us different
DavidChristian_2011_120 exploiting a sudden change in global climate with the end of the last ice age humans learned to farm 
DavidChristian_2011_121 farming was an energy bonanza and exploiting that energy human populations multiplied human societies got larger denser more interconnected
DavidChristian_2011_123 humans began to link up globally through shipping through trains through telegraph through the internet until now we seem to form a single 
DavidChristian_2011_128 back at the convention center we've been on a journey a return journey of thirteen point seven billion years i hope you agree this is a
DavidChristian_2011_130 collective learning is a very very powerful force and it's not clear that we humans are in charge of it
DavidChristian_2011_131 i remember very vividly as a child growing up in england living through the cuban missile crisis for a
DavidChristian_2011_139 i want my grandson daniel and his friends and his generation throughout the world to know the
DavidChristian_2011_140 story of big history and to know it so well
DavidChristian_2011_145 i thank you for your attention
