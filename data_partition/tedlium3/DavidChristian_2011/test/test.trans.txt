DavidChristian_2011_0 a scrambled egg but as you look at it i hope you'll begin to feel just
DavidChristian_2011_1 slightly uneasy
DavidChristian_2011_2 because you may notice that what's actually happening is that the egg is unscrambling itself
DavidChristian_2011_5 and we know in our heart of hearts that the universe does not travel from mush to complexity 
DavidChristian_2011_7 what that says basically
DavidChristian_2011_8 is that the general tendency of the universe is to move from order and structure
DavidChristian_2011_10 look around us
DavidChristian_2011_18 goldilocks conditions not too hot not too cold just right for the creation of complexity
DavidChristian_2011_20 each stage is magical because it creates the impression of something utterly new appearing almost
DavidChristian_2011_21 out of nowhere in the universe we refer in big history to these moments as threshold moments 
DavidChristian_2011_22 and at each threshold the going gets tougher the complex things get more fragile
DavidChristian_2011_23 more vulnerable the goldilocks conditions get more stringent and it's more difficult to create
DavidChristian_2011_31 bang a universe appears an entire universe and we've crossed our first threshold the universe is tiny it's smaller than an atom it's incredibly hot it contains everything 
DavidChristian_2011_32 that's in today's universe so you can imagine it's busting and it's expanding at incredible
DavidChristian_2011_34 and at first it's just a blur but very quickly distinct things begin to appear in that blur 
DavidChristian_2011_37 quarks that will create protons and leptons that include electrons and all of that
DavidChristian_2011_38 in the first second
DavidChristian_2011_39 now we move forward three hundred and eighty thousand years
DavidChristian_2011_42 because we actually know quite a lot about the universe at this stage
DavidChristian_2011_43 we know above all that it was extremely simple it consisted of huge clouds of hydrogen and helium atoms and they have no structure they're really a sort of cosmic mush
DavidChristian_2011_44 but that's not completely true 
DavidChristian_2011_45 recent studies by satellites such as the wmap satellite have shown that in fact there are just tiny differences in that background what you see here 
DavidChristian_2011_48 gravity is more powerful where there's more stuff so where you get slightly denser areas
DavidChristian_2011_49 gravity starts compacting clouds of hydrogen and helium atoms so we can imagine the early universe breaking up into a billion clouds and each cloud is compacted gravity gets more powerful 
DavidChristian_2011_54 stars will create the goldilocks conditions for crossing two new thresholds 
DavidChristian_2011_55 when very large stars die they create temperatures so high
DavidChristian_2011_58 and what starts happening is that around young suns young stars
DavidChristian_2011_63 the going gets tougher 
DavidChristian_2011_66 living organisms are created by chemistry we are huge packages of chemicals
DavidChristian_2011_69 what are the goldilocks conditions well
DavidChristian_2011_70 you need energy 
DavidChristian_2011_75 you also need a great diversity of chemical elements and you need liquids such as water why
DavidChristian_2011_79 well planets are great and our early earth was almost perfect
DavidChristian_2011_87 you don't stabilize the individual you stabilize the template
DavidChristian_2011_90 and dna also copies itself so it copies itself and scatters the templates through the ocean so the information spreads notice that information has become part of our story 
DavidChristian_2011_93 dna's learning and it's building greater diversity and greater complexity and we can see this happening over the last four billion years
DavidChristian_2011_95 then from about six hundred to eight hundred million years ago multi celled organisms appear you get fungi you get fish
DavidChristian_2011_96 you get plants you get amphibia you get reptiles and then of course you get the dinosaurs 
DavidChristian_2011_100 terrible news for the dinosaurs 
DavidChristian_2011_105 we've seen that dna learns in a sense it accumulates information but it is so slow
DavidChristian_2011_108 learn in real time they accumulate information they learn the sad thing is when they die the information dies with them
DavidChristian_2011_111 we are blessed with a language a system of communication so powerful and so precise that we can share what we've learned with such precision that it can accumulate in the collective memory
DavidChristian_2011_112 that means it can outlast the individuals who learned that information and it can accumulate from generation to generation and that's why as a species we're so creative and so powerful and that's why we have a history
DavidChristian_2011_115 we can see it at work in the earliest stages of human history 
DavidChristian_2011_118 each migration involved learning learning new ways of exploiting the environment new ways
DavidChristian_2011_119 of dealing with their surroundings then ten thousand years ago 
DavidChristian_2011_122 and then from about five hundred years ago 
DavidChristian_2011_126 so
DavidChristian_2011_129 and it's a story in which humans play an astonishing and creative role but it also contains warnings
DavidChristian_2011_132 the entire biosphere seemed to be on the verge of destruction and the same weapons are still here and they are still armed 
DavidChristian_2011_133 if we avoid that trap
DavidChristian_2011_134 others are waiting for us we're burning fossil fuels at such a rate that we seem to be undermining the goldilocks conditions that made it possible for human civilizations to flourish over the last ten thousand years 
DavidChristian_2011_135 so what big history can do is
DavidChristian_2011_136 show us the nature of our complexity and fragility and the dangers that face us but it can also show us
DavidChristian_2011_137 our power with collective learning and now finally
DavidChristian_2011_138 this is what i want
DavidChristian_2011_142 and that's why a group of us are building a free online syllabus in big history for high school students throughout the world 
DavidChristian_2011_144 and his generation face the huge challenges and also the huge opportunities ahead of them at this threshold moment in the history of our beautiful planet
