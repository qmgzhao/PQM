DavidChristian_2011_0 a scrambled egg but as you look at it i hope you'll begin to feel just
DavidChristian_2011_1 slightly uneasy
DavidChristian_2011_2 because you may notice that what's actually happening is that the egg is unscrambling itself
DavidChristian_2011_3 and you'll now see the yolk and the white have separated and now they're going to be poured back into the egg and we all know in our heart of hearts that this is not the way the universe works
DavidChristian_2011_4 a scrambled egg is mush tasty mush but it's mush an egg is a beautiful sophisticated thing that can create even more sophisticated things such as chickens 
DavidChristian_2011_5 and we know in our heart of hearts that the universe does not travel from mush to complexity 
DavidChristian_2011_6 in fact this gut instinct is reflected in one of the most fundamental laws of physics the second law of thermodynamics or the law of
DavidChristian_2011_7 what that says basically
DavidChristian_2011_8 is that the general tendency of the universe is to move from order and structure
DavidChristian_2011_9 to lack of order lack of structure in fact to mush and that's why that video feels a bit strange and yet 
DavidChristian_2011_10 look around us
DavidChristian_2011_11 what we see around us is staggering complexity eric beinhocker estimates that in new york city alone there are some ten billion
DavidChristian_2011_12 skus or distinct commodities being traded
DavidChristian_2011_13 that's hundreds of times as many species as there are on earth 
DavidChristian_2011_14 and they're being traded by a species of almost seven billion individuals who are linked by trade travel and the internet into a global system of stupendous complexity 
DavidChristian_2011_15 a universe ruled by the second law of thermodynamics how is it possible to generate the sort of complexity i've described the sort of complexity represented by you and me and the convention center 
DavidChristian_2011_16 well the answer seems to be the universe can create complexity but with great difficulty
DavidChristian_2011_17 in pockets there appear what my colleague fred spier calls
DavidChristian_2011_18 goldilocks conditions not too hot not too cold just right for the creation of complexity
DavidChristian_2011_19 and slightly more complex things appear and where you have slightly more complex things you can get slightly more complex things and in this way complexity builds stage by stage
DavidChristian_2011_20 each stage is magical because it creates the impression of something utterly new appearing almost
DavidChristian_2011_21 out of nowhere in the universe we refer in big history to these moments as threshold moments 
DavidChristian_2011_22 and at each threshold the going gets tougher the complex things get more fragile
DavidChristian_2011_23 more vulnerable the goldilocks conditions get more stringent and it's more difficult to create
DavidChristian_2011_24 as extremely complex creatures desperately need to know this story of how the universe creates complexity despite the second law and why complexity means vulnerability and fragility
DavidChristian_2011_25 and that's the story that we tell in big history but to do it you have do something that may at first sight seem completely impossible you have to survey the whole history of the universe 
DavidChristian_2011_26 do it
DavidChristian_2011_27 let's begin by winding the timeline back thirteen point seven billion years to the beginning of time
DavidChristian_2011_28 around us
DavidChristian_2011_29 emptiest thing you can
DavidChristian_2011_30 and cube it a gazillion times and that's where we are and then suddenly
DavidChristian_2011_31 bang a universe appears an entire universe and we've crossed our first threshold the universe is tiny it's smaller than an atom it's incredibly hot it contains everything 
DavidChristian_2011_32 that's in today's universe so you can imagine it's busting and it's expanding at incredible
DavidChristian_2011_33 speed
DavidChristian_2011_34 and at first it's just a blur but very quickly distinct things begin to appear in that blur 
DavidChristian_2011_35 within the first second energy itself shatters into distinct forces including electromagnetism and gravity
DavidChristian_2011_36 and energy does something else quite magical it congeals to form matter
DavidChristian_2011_37 quarks that will create protons and leptons that include electrons and all of that
DavidChristian_2011_38 in the first second
DavidChristian_2011_39 now we move forward three hundred and eighty thousand years
DavidChristian_2011_40 that's twice as long as humans have been on this planet and now simple atoms appear of hydrogen and helium
DavidChristian_2011_41 now i want to pause for a moment three hundred and eighty thousand years after the origins of the universe
DavidChristian_2011_42 because we actually know quite a lot about the universe at this stage
DavidChristian_2011_43 we know above all that it was extremely simple it consisted of huge clouds of hydrogen and helium atoms and they have no structure they're really a sort of cosmic mush
DavidChristian_2011_44 but that's not completely true 
DavidChristian_2011_45 recent studies by satellites such as the wmap satellite have shown that in fact there are just tiny differences in that background what you see here 
DavidChristian_2011_46 the blue areas
DavidChristian_2011_47 are about a thousandth of a degree cooler than the red areas these are tiny differences but it was enough for the universe to move on to the next stage of building complexity and this is how it works 
DavidChristian_2011_48 gravity is more powerful where there's more stuff so where you get slightly denser areas
DavidChristian_2011_49 gravity starts compacting clouds of hydrogen and helium atoms so we can imagine the early universe breaking up into a billion clouds and each cloud is compacted gravity gets more powerful 
DavidChristian_2011_50 as density increases the temperature begins to rise at the center of each cloud and then at the center the temperature crosses the threshold temperature of ten million degrees protons start to fuse there's a huge release of
DavidChristian_2011_51 we have our first stars
DavidChristian_2011_52 from about two hundred million years after the big bang stars begin to appear all through the universe billions of them 
DavidChristian_2011_53 and the universe is now significantly more interesting and more complex
DavidChristian_2011_54 stars will create the goldilocks conditions for crossing two new thresholds 
DavidChristian_2011_55 when very large stars die they create temperatures so high
DavidChristian_2011_56 that protons begin to fuse in all sorts of exotic combinations to form all the elements of the periodic table if like me you're wearing a gold ring it was forged in a supernova explosion 
DavidChristian_2011_57 so now the universe is chemically more complex and in a chemically more complex universe it's possible to make more things
DavidChristian_2011_58 and what starts happening is that around young suns young stars
DavidChristian_2011_59 all these elements combine they swirl around the energy of the star stirs them around they form particles they form snowflakes they form little dust motes they form 
DavidChristian_2011_60 rocks they form asteroids and eventually they form planets and moons and that is how our solar system was formed four and a half billion
DavidChristian_2011_61 rocky planets like our earth are significantly more complex than stars because they contain a much greater diversity of materials so we've crossed a fourth threshold of complexity 
DavidChristian_2011_62 now
DavidChristian_2011_63 the going gets tougher 
DavidChristian_2011_64 the next stage introduces entities that are significantly more fragile significantly more vulnerable but they're also much more creative and much more capable of generating further complexity
DavidChristian_2011_65 i'm talking of course about living organisms
DavidChristian_2011_66 living organisms are created by chemistry we are huge packages of chemicals
DavidChristian_2011_67 so chemistry is dominated by the electromagnetic force that operates over smaller scales than gravity which explains why you and i are smaller than stars or planets
DavidChristian_2011_68 now what are the ideal conditions for chemistry
DavidChristian_2011_69 what are the goldilocks conditions well
DavidChristian_2011_70 you need energy 
DavidChristian_2011_71 but not too much in the center of a star there's so much energy that any atoms that combine will just get busted apart again but not too little
DavidChristian_2011_72 in intergalactic space there's so little energy that atoms can't combine 
DavidChristian_2011_73 what you want is just the right amount and planets it turns out are just right because they're close to stars
DavidChristian_2011_74 but not too close
DavidChristian_2011_75 you also need a great diversity of chemical elements and you need liquids such as water why
DavidChristian_2011_76 well in gases atoms move past each other so fast that they can't hitch up
DavidChristian_2011_77 in solids atoms are stuck together they can't move in liquids they can cruise and cuddle
DavidChristian_2011_78 and link up to form molecules now where do you find such goldilocks conditions
DavidChristian_2011_79 well planets are great and our early earth was almost perfect
DavidChristian_2011_80 it was just the right distance from its star to contain huge oceans of liquid water and deep beneath those oceans at cracks in the earth's crust
DavidChristian_2011_81 you've got heat seeping up from inside the earth and you've got a great diversity of elements so at those deep oceanic vents 
DavidChristian_2011_82 fantastic chemistry began to happen
DavidChristian_2011_83 atoms combined in all sorts of exotic combinations 
DavidChristian_2011_84 but of course life is more than just exotic chemistry
DavidChristian_2011_85 how do you stabilize those huge molecules that seem to be viable well
DavidChristian_2011_86 it's here that life introduces an entirely new trick
DavidChristian_2011_87 you don't stabilize the individual you stabilize the template
DavidChristian_2011_88 thing that carries information and you allow the template to copy itself and dna of course is the beautiful molecule that contains that information you
DavidChristian_2011_89 'll be familiar with the double helix of dna each rung contains information so dna contains information about how to make living organisms
DavidChristian_2011_90 and dna also copies itself so it copies itself and scatters the templates through the ocean so the information spreads notice that information has become part of our story 
DavidChristian_2011_91 the real beauty of dna though is in its imperfections as it copies itself once in every billion rungs there tends to be an error and what that means
DavidChristian_2011_92 is that dna is in effect learning it's accumulating new ways of making living organisms because some of those errors work
DavidChristian_2011_93 dna's learning and it's building greater diversity and greater complexity and we can see this happening over the last four billion years
DavidChristian_2011_94 for most of that time of life on earth living organisms have been relatively simple single cells but they had great diversity and inside great complexity 
DavidChristian_2011_95 then from about six hundred to eight hundred million years ago multi celled organisms appear you get fungi you get fish
DavidChristian_2011_96 you get plants you get amphibia you get reptiles and then of course you get the dinosaurs 
DavidChristian_2011_97 and occasionally there are disasters
DavidChristian_2011_98 million years ago an asteroid landed on earth near the yucatan peninsula creating conditions equivalent to those of a nuclear
DavidChristian_2011_99 and the dinosaurs were wiped out
DavidChristian_2011_100 terrible news for the dinosaurs 
DavidChristian_2011_101 but great news for our mammalian ancestors who flourished in the niches left empty by the dinosaurs and we human beings 
DavidChristian_2011_102 are part of that creative evolutionary pulse that began sixty five million years ago with the landing of an asteroid
DavidChristian_2011_103 humans appeared about two hundred thousand years ago and i believe we count
DavidChristian_2011_104 as a threshold in this great story let me explain why
DavidChristian_2011_105 we've seen that dna learns in a sense it accumulates information but it is so slow
DavidChristian_2011_106 dna accumulates information through random errors some of which just happen to work 
DavidChristian_2011_107 but dna had actually generated a faster way of learning it had produced organisms with brains and those organisms can learn
DavidChristian_2011_108 learn in real time they accumulate information they learn the sad thing is when they die the information dies with them
DavidChristian_2011_109 now what makes humans different
DavidChristian_2011_110 is human language 
DavidChristian_2011_111 we are blessed with a language a system of communication so powerful and so precise that we can share what we've learned with such precision that it can accumulate in the collective memory
DavidChristian_2011_112 that means it can outlast the individuals who learned that information and it can accumulate from generation to generation and that's why as a species we're so creative and so powerful and that's why we have a history
DavidChristian_2011_113 we seem to be the only species in four billion years to have this gift
DavidChristian_2011_114 i call this ability collective learning it's what makes us different
DavidChristian_2011_115 we can see it at work in the earliest stages of human history 
DavidChristian_2011_116 we evolved as a species in the savanna lands of africa 
DavidChristian_2011_117 but then you see humans migrating into new environments into desert lands into jungles into the ice age tundra of siberia tough tough environment into the americas into australasia
DavidChristian_2011_118 each migration involved learning learning new ways of exploiting the environment new ways
DavidChristian_2011_119 of dealing with their surroundings then ten thousand years ago 
DavidChristian_2011_120 exploiting a sudden change in global climate with the end of the last ice age humans learned to farm 
DavidChristian_2011_121 farming was an energy bonanza and exploiting that energy human populations multiplied human societies got larger denser more interconnected
DavidChristian_2011_122 and then from about five hundred years ago 
DavidChristian_2011_123 humans began to link up globally through shipping through trains through telegraph through the internet until now we seem to form a single 
DavidChristian_2011_124 global brain of almost seven billion individuals and that brain is learning at warp speed 
DavidChristian_2011_125 collective learning together explain the staggering complexity we see around us 
DavidChristian_2011_126 so
DavidChristian_2011_127 here we are
DavidChristian_2011_128 back at the convention center we've been on a journey a return journey of thirteen point seven billion years i hope you agree this is a
DavidChristian_2011_129 and it's a story in which humans play an astonishing and creative role but it also contains warnings
DavidChristian_2011_130 collective learning is a very very powerful force and it's not clear that we humans are in charge of it
DavidChristian_2011_131 i remember very vividly as a child growing up in england living through the cuban missile crisis for a
DavidChristian_2011_132 the entire biosphere seemed to be on the verge of destruction and the same weapons are still here and they are still armed 
DavidChristian_2011_133 if we avoid that trap
DavidChristian_2011_134 others are waiting for us we're burning fossil fuels at such a rate that we seem to be undermining the goldilocks conditions that made it possible for human civilizations to flourish over the last ten thousand years 
DavidChristian_2011_135 so what big history can do is
DavidChristian_2011_136 show us the nature of our complexity and fragility and the dangers that face us but it can also show us
DavidChristian_2011_137 our power with collective learning and now finally
DavidChristian_2011_138 this is what i want
DavidChristian_2011_139 i want my grandson daniel and his friends and his generation throughout the world to know the
DavidChristian_2011_140 story of big history and to know it so well
DavidChristian_2011_141 that they understand both the challenges that face us and the opportunities that face us
DavidChristian_2011_142 and that's why a group of us are building a free online syllabus in big history for high school students throughout the world 
DavidChristian_2011_143 we believe that big history will be a vital intellectual tool for them as daniel
DavidChristian_2011_144 and his generation face the huge challenges and also the huge opportunities ahead of them at this threshold moment in the history of our beautiful planet 
DavidChristian_2011_145 i thank you for your attention
