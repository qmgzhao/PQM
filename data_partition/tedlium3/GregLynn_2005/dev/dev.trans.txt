GregLynn_2005_0 i would talk about today is the transition from one mode of thinking about nature to another that's tracked by architecture what's interesting about architects is
GregLynn_2005_14 calculus to define their forms but what was important is the gothic moment in architecture was the first time that force and motion was thought of in terms of form 
GregLynn_2005_18 and vaulting
GregLynn_2005_21 interestingly in the last ten years norman foster used a similar heat thermal transfer model to generate the roof of the national gallery with the structural engineer chris williams
GregLynn_2005_26 my hero is actually not darwin it's a guy named william bateson father of greg bateson who was here for a long time
GregLynn_2005_31 so what he found is that in all cases of thumb mutations instead of
GregLynn_2005_37 symmetry was the absence of information so whenever you lost information you'd move to symmetry
GregLynn_2005_44 means that we don't have to think about dimension in terms of ideal units or
GregLynn_2005_48 i haven't verified this but it's the norm that every chair would be a slightly different dimension
GregLynn_2005_54 this digital medium of curvature the intricacies of scale that come out of that you know in the example of the nose to the face there's a fractional 
GregLynn_2005_56 too early in the morning for a lecture on calculus so i brought some images to just describe how that works this
GregLynn_2005_60 or possibly construct it is by using a 
GregLynn_2005_79 you move down the length of the building so working with
GregLynn_2005_81 so that if we change any element along the length of the building not only does that change distribute through each one of the trusses 
GregLynn_2005_82 but each one of the trusses then distributes that information down the length of the entire facade of the building so it's a single calculation
GregLynn_2005_84 that we're adding onto so it's tens of millions of calculations just to design one connection between
GregLynn_2005_91 not to pick on bmw or to celebrate them but
GregLynn_2005_94 has to look like the seven hundred series at the other end of their product line so they need a distinct coherent identity which is bmw
GregLynn_2005_98 design options
GregLynn_2005_114 that they would have a coherence so they would be greg lynn alessi coffee pots but that everyone who bought one would have a one of a kind object that was unique in some way
GregLynn_2005_117 but also break down into small rooms and have an identity of both the big scale and the small scale
GregLynn_2005_118 architects tend to work
GregLynn_2005_119 with signature
GregLynn_2005_121 and intricacy which is the relationship of say the shape of a building its structure its windows its color its pattern
GregLynn_2005_130 we also used a continuity of change from a main exhibition hall to a natural history museum so it's all one
GregLynn_2005_131 continuous change in the massing but within that massing are very different kinds of spaces and forms
GregLynn_2005_139 how we were approaching the problem of incredibly large scale construction we wanted to make a kind of gothic cathedral around the footprints of the world trade center site
GregLynn_2005_142 there were numerous examples of other architects trying to do the same thing
GregLynn_2005_144 with united architects also we made a proposal for the european central bank headquarters that used the same system
