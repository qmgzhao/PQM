GregLynn_2005_3 was whether the number five or the number seven was a better proportion to think about architecture because the nose was one fifth of your head
GregLynn_2005_5 of your body
GregLynn_2005_6 and the reason that that was the model of beauty and of nature was because the decimal point had not been invented yet it wasn't the 16th century
GregLynn_2005_17 the end of the 19th century beginning of the 20th century and how that hanging chain model translates into archways
GregLynn_2005_19 so in all of these examples structure is the determining force frei otto was starting to use foam bubble diagrams
GregLynn_2005_24 bring up is another component that needs to be thought of whenever you think about nature and that's basically the invention of
GregLynn_2005_27 in monterey and he was what you'd call a teratologist he looked at all of the monstrosities and mutations to find rules 
GregLynn_2005_29 he has two kinds of mutations of a human thumb when i first saw this image 
GregLynn_2005_30 ten years ago i actually found it very strange and beautiful at the same time beautiful because it has symmetry 
GregLynn_2005_32 having a thumb you would either get another opposable thumb or you would get four fingers so the mutations reverted
GregLynn_2005_33 to symmetry 
GregLynn_2005_38 you added information to a system you would break symmetry so this whole idea of natural form
GregLynn_2005_43 to just talk for a minute about the digital mediums that we're using now and how they integrate calculus the fact that 
GregLynn_2005_45 in architecture we deal with big assemblies of components so there might be
GregLynn_2005_47 that all need to get organized now typically you'd think that they would all be the same like the chairs you're sitting in would all be the same dimension you know
GregLynn_2005_50 the elements that make up the ceiling grid and the lighting they're all losing their modular quality and moving more and more to these infinitesimal dimensions that's because we're all using calculus tools for manufacturing
GregLynn_2005_51 and for design
GregLynn_2005_55 with calculus the whole idea of subdivision is more complex because the whole and the parts are one continuous series it's
GregLynn_2005_57 is a korean church that we did in queens and in this example you can see that the components of this
GregLynn_2005_59 is a unique distance and dimension and all of the connections are unique angles now the only way we could design that
GregLynn_2005_62 opens and closes in a very dynamic way as you move across it because it has this quality of vector in motion built into it so the same space that appears to be a kind 
GregLynn_2005_65 that we're starting to look now not for some ideal form like a latin cross for a church but actually all the traits of a church so 
GregLynn_2005_66 light that comes from behind from an invisible source
GregLynn_2005_67 directionality that focuses you towards an altar it turns out it's not
GregLynn_2005_68 rocket science to design a sacred space you just need to incorporate a certain
GregLynn_2005_70 so these are the different perspectives of that interior which has a very complex set of orientations all in a simple form
GregLynn_2005_74 i won't go into too much description of any of these projects but what you can see is that the escalators and elevators that circulate people along the face of the building
GregLynn_2005_75 are all held up by one hundred and
GregLynn_2005_76 structural trusses
GregLynn_2005_77 because we're using escalators to move people all of these trusses are picking up diagonal
GregLynn_2005_78 loads so every one of them is a little bit 
GregLynn_2005_85 a piece of structural steel and another piece of structural steel but what it gives us is a harmonic and synthesized
GregLynn_2005_86 relationship of all these components one to another
GregLynn_2005_87 this idea has kind of brought me into doing some product design and it's because
GregLynn_2005_92 take bmw as an example they have to in two thousand and
GregLynn_2005_95 at the same time there's a person paying thirty thousand dollars for a 300 series car and a person paying seventy thousand dollars for a seven hundred series and that person paying more than double
GregLynn_2005_96 doesn't want their car to look too much like the bottom of the market car so they have to also discriminate between these products so 
GregLynn_2005_102 knew that at the beginning so i actually went to some people i knew down south in san diego and we used
GregLynn_2005_103 just cut a
GregLynn_2005_104 graphite mold put it in an oven heat it to one thousand degrees
GregLynn_2005_106 but what's great about it is the forms are only a few hundred dollars the titanium's several thousand dollars but the forms are very cheap 
GregLynn_2005_107 so we designed a system here
GregLynn_2005_108 of eight curves that could be swapped
GregLynn_2005_110 and we could recombine those together so that we always had ergonomic shapes that always had the same volume and could always be produced in the same way that 
GregLynn_2005_111 way each one of these tools we could pay for with a few hundred dollars and get incredible variation in the components
GregLynn_2005_112 this is one of those examples of the sets
GregLynn_2005_113 so for me what was important is that this coffee set which is just a coffee pot a teapot and those are the pots sitting on a tray
GregLynn_2005_115 to go back to architecture what's organic about architecture as a field unlike product design
GregLynn_2005_116 is this whole issue of holism and of monumentality is really our realm like we have to design things which are coherent as a single object
GregLynn_2005_120 so that an architect needs a signature and that signature has to work across the scale of houses up to say skyscrapers and that problem of signatures is a thing we're very good at maintaining and working with
GregLynn_2005_124 for this in the natural world are these tropical frogs i got
GregLynn_2005_125 in them because they're the most extreme example of a surface where the texture and the
GregLynn_2005_127 are all intricately connected to one another so a change in the form indicates a change in the color pattern 
GregLynn_2005_129 a center for the national parks in costa rica we tried to use that idea of a gradient color and a change in texture as the structure moves across the surface of the building 
GregLynn_2005_132 in a housing project in valencia spain we're doing the
GregLynn_2005_134 into individual elements 
GregLynn_2005_136 limit an envelope of change
GregLynn_2005_138 and i think this just shows how
GregLynn_2005_140 and to do that we tried to connect up
