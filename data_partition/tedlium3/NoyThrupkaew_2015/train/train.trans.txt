NoyThrupkaew_2015_13 also requires letting go 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_14 but my clearest and sharpest memory of my auntie is also one of my first memories of life at all 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_15 i remember her being beaten and slapped by another member of my family 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_17 friends or being a little late 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_18 i became so hysterical over her treatment that eventually she was just beaten behind closed doors
NoyThrupkaew_2015_24 that i owed perhaps the best parts of who i became to her care
NoyThrupkaew_2015_26 over everything she had endured to care for me for as long as she had
NoyThrupkaew_2015_32 because human trafficking is far more prevalent complex and close to home than most of us realize 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_33 i spent time in jails and brothels interviewed hundreds of survivors and law enforcement ngo workers and when i think about what we've done about human trafficking
NoyThrupkaew_2015_39 i call that look at her scars journalism
NoyThrupkaew_2015_41 it takes away all the societal context that we might be indicted for for the structural inequality or the poverty or the barriers to migration 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_42 we let ourselves think that human trafficking is only about forced prostitution 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_43 when in reality human trafficking is embedded in our everyday lives
NoyThrupkaew_2015_44 let me show you what i mean forced prostitution accounts for
NoyThrupkaew_2015_45 human trafficking 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_49 that is food and care and shelter
NoyThrupkaew_2015_51 workers are also among the world's most underpaid and exploited today 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_52 human trafficking is the use of force fraud or coercion to compel another person's labor
NoyThrupkaew_2015_55 industry that country has become the largest exporter of shrimp in the world 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_58 those fishing boats were taken out the men put to work and they were thrown overboard if they made the mistake of falling sick or
NoyThrupkaew_2015_59 trying to resist their treatment 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_60 those fish were then used to feed shrimp the shrimp were then sold to four major global retailers 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_61 costco tesco walmart and carrefour
NoyThrupkaew_2015_65 trafficking has even been found in a hair braiding salon in new jersey the scheme in that case was incredible the traffickers found
NoyThrupkaew_2015_67 they then located winners of the green card lottery and they told them we'll help you out we'll get you a plane ticket we'll pay your fees
NoyThrupkaew_2015_68 all you have to do is take this young girl with you say that she's your sister or your spouse 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_69 once everyone arrived in new jersey the young girls were taken away and put to work for 14 hour days seven days a week for five years
NoyThrupkaew_2015_70 they made their traffickers nearly four million dollars
NoyThrupkaew_2015_74 criminal justice system is too often part of the problem rather than the solution
NoyThrupkaew_2015_75 in study after study in countries ranging from bangladesh to the united states between twenty and sixty percent
NoyThrupkaew_2015_77 people in prostitution including people who have been trafficked into it regularly receive multiple convictions for prostitution
NoyThrupkaew_2015_78 having that criminal record makes it so much more difficult to leave poverty leave abuse or leave prostitution if that person so desires
NoyThrupkaew_2015_79 workers outside of the sex sector if they try and resist their treatment they risk deportation
NoyThrupkaew_2015_82 workers
NoyThrupkaew_2015_83 if those workers run away they risk becoming part of the great mass of undocumented workers who are also subject to the whims of law enforcement if they're caught
NoyThrupkaew_2015_84 law enforcement is supposed to identify victims and prosecute traffickers
NoyThrupkaew_2015_86 world they have helped and identified fewer than fifty thousand people that's like comparing
NoyThrupkaew_2015_87 the population of the world to the population of los angeles proportionally speaking
NoyThrupkaew_2015_88 as for convictions
NoyThrupkaew_2015_92 i've heard one expert say that trafficking happens where need meets greed
NoyThrupkaew_2015_93 i'd like to add one more element to that
NoyThrupkaew_2015_97 let me tell you what that looks like
NoyThrupkaew_2015_98 i spent many months researching a trafficking case called global
NoyThrupkaew_2015_100 they were promised three years of solid agricultural work
NoyThrupkaew_2015_102 they were brought over
NoyThrupkaew_2015_103 their passports were confiscated some of the men were beaten and held at gunpoint they worked so hard they fainted in the fields 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_104 this case hit me so hard
NoyThrupkaew_2015_108 aren't these the kind of strawberries you eat with somebody special in the states 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_109 and don't they taste so much better when you know the people whose hands picked them for you
NoyThrupkaew_2015_110 as i stood in that grocery store weeks later i realized i had no idea
NoyThrupkaew_2015_119 is merely what we find legally tolerable 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_125 totally agree
NoyThrupkaew_2015_127 if we demanded laws calling for the same 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_130 these would be decisions heard around the world 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_132 this is the decision to change a system that is broken and that we have unwittingly but willingly allowed ourselves to profit from and benefit from for too long
NoyThrupkaew_2015_135 over all the years that i've been talking to them they have
NoyThrupkaew_2015_145 they came together and they decided that they were going to make the world's first anti trafficking organization actually headed and run by trafficking survivors themselves
NoyThrupkaew_2015_149 bring to light exploitation and abuses in supply chains in walmart and hershey's factories and although the department of justice declined to take their case
NoyThrupkaew_2015_151 february and got their clients fourteen million dollars
NoyThrupkaew_2015_152 these survivors are fighting for people they don't even know yet 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_154 this is our chance to do the same 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_155 this is our chance to make the decision that tells us who we are as a people and as a society that our prosperity
NoyThrupkaew_2015_156 is no longer prosperity as long as it is pinned to other people's pain 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_163 i also haven't done my journalistic due diligence on this i haven't issued my mountains of document requests and interviewed everyone and their mother 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_164 and i haven't found my auntie yet i don't know her story of what happened
NoyThrupkaew_2015_166 the story as i've told it to you is messy and unfinished 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_169 but that means we are all also part of its solution 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_170 figuring out
NoyThrupkaew_2015_172 so let us tell it the way we should have done from the very beginning let us tell this story together thank you so much
