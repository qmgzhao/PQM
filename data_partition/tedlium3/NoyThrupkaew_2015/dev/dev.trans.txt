NoyThrupkaew_2015_2 i don't think that's actually the case because if it were we'd be dealing with things that are far more complicated than just this it
NoyThrupkaew_2015_5 and whenever i tried to make a joke she would look at me and say
NoyThrupkaew_2015_7 so i knew i had to be serious and i asked my parents who had actually raised me until i was three and to my surprise they said
NoyThrupkaew_2015_10 i remember the thick straight hair and how it would come around me like a curtain when she bent to pick me up
NoyThrupkaew_2015_11 her soft southern thai accent the way i would cling to her even if she just wanted to go to the bathroom or get something to eat
NoyThrupkaew_2015_20 as an adult i learned later that she had been just nineteen when she was brought over from thailand to the states to care for me on a tourist visa
NoyThrupkaew_2015_22 i clung to her again as i had when i was a child and i let go and then i promised that i would call 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_23 i never did though because i was afraid if i said everything that she meant to me
NoyThrupkaew_2015_30 and even so i never put together this personal story with my professional life until pretty
NoyThrupkaew_2015_31 i think this profound disconnect actually symbolizes most of our understanding about human trafficking 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_34 partly because we don't even talk about the problem right at all
NoyThrupkaew_2015_35 when i say human trafficking most of you probably don't think about someone like my auntie
NoyThrupkaew_2015_37 that is real suffering and that is a real story that story makes me angry for far more than just the reality of that situation
NoyThrupkaew_2015_56 but what are the circumstances behind all that cheap and plentiful shrimp
NoyThrupkaew_2015_62 human trafficking is found on a smaller scale than just that and in places you would never even imagine
NoyThrupkaew_2015_72 but keep in mind most victims of human trafficking are poor and marginalized they're migrants people of color sometimes they're in the sex trade 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_81 to try and threaten or deport their striking trafficked
NoyThrupkaew_2015_89 out of an estimated five thousand seven hundred convictions in two thousand and thirteen fewer than five hundred were for labor trafficking
NoyThrupkaew_2015_91 trafficking accounts for sixty eight percent of all trafficking but fewer than ten percent of the convictions
NoyThrupkaew_2015_94 trafficking happens in sectors where workers are excluded from protections and denied the right to organize
NoyThrupkaew_2015_105 after i came back home i was wandering through the grocery store and i froze in the produce department 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_111 of who to thank for this plenty and no idea of how they were being treated
NoyThrupkaew_2015_116 the global horizons survivors had been brought to the states on a temporary guest worker program
NoyThrupkaew_2015_118 mind you none of what i am describing about this agricultural sector or the guest worker program is actually
NoyThrupkaew_2015_126 what would happen if each one of us decided that we are no longer going to support companies if they don't eliminate exploitation from their labor and supply chains
NoyThrupkaew_2015_129 if we ended recruitment fees for migrant workers if we decided that guest workers should have the right to organize without fear of retaliation 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_131 this isn't a matter of buying a fair trade peach and calling it a day buying a guilt free zone with your money that's not how it works
NoyThrupkaew_2015_134 but that is not my experience of them
NoyThrupkaew_2015_136 taught me that we are more than our worst days each one of us is more than what we have lived through
NoyThrupkaew_2015_142 they need solidarity because they're behind some of the most exciting social justice movements out there today 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_157 that our lives are inextricably woven together 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_159 i was so reluctant
NoyThrupkaew_2015_160 to share my story of my auntie with you before i started this ted process and climbed up on this stage
NoyThrupkaew_2015_161 told literally a handful of people about it
NoyThrupkaew_2015_167 but i think it mirrors the messy and unfinished situation we're all in when it comes to human trafficking
