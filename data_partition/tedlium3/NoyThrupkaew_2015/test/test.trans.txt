NoyThrupkaew_2015_0 ten years ago i went through a little bit of a hard time
NoyThrupkaew_2015_1 so i decided to go see a therapist i had been seeing her for a few months when she looked at me one day and said who actually raised you until you were three
NoyThrupkaew_2015_3 sounded like the setup to a joke but i knew she was serious 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_4 because when i first started seeing her i was trying to be the funniest person in the room and i would try and crack these jokes but she caught on to me really quickly 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_6 that is actually really sad 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_8 my primary caregiver had been a distant relative of the family i had called her my auntie i remember my auntie so
NoyThrupkaew_2015_9 clearly it felt like she had been part of my life when i was much older 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_12 i loved her but [ with ] the ferocity that a child has sometimes before she understands that love
NoyThrupkaew_2015_16 i remember screaming hysterically and wanting it to stop as i did every single time it happened for things as minor as wanting to go out with her
NoyThrupkaew_2015_19 things got so bad for her that eventually she ran away 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_21 she wound up working in illinois for a time before eventually returning to thailand which is where i ran into her again at a political rally in bangkok 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_25 and that the words i'm sorry were like a thimble to bail out all the guilt and shame and rage i felt
NoyThrupkaew_2015_27 i thought if i said those words to her i would never stop crying again
NoyThrupkaew_2015_28 had saved me and i had not saved her 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_29 i'm a journalist and i've been writing and researching human trafficking for the past eight years or so 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_36 you probably think about a young girl or woman who's been brutally forced into prostitution by a violent pimp 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_38 as a journalist i really care about how we relate to each other through language and the way we tell that story with all the gory violent detail the salacious aspects
NoyThrupkaew_2015_40 we use that story to convince ourselves that human trafficking is a bad man doing a bad thing to an innocent girl that story lets us off the hook
NoyThrupkaew_2015_46 ten percent is in state imposed forced labor
NoyThrupkaew_2015_47 but a whopping sixty eight percent is for the purpose of creating the goods and delivering the services that most of us rely on every day
NoyThrupkaew_2015_48 in sectors like agricultural work domestic work and construction 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_50 and somehow these most essential
NoyThrupkaew_2015_53 and it's found in cotton fields and coltan mines and even car washes in norway and england
NoyThrupkaew_2015_54 it's found in u s military bases in iraq and afghanistan it's found in thailand's fishing industry
NoyThrupkaew_2015_57 thai military were caught selling burmese and cambodian migrants onto fishing boats
NoyThrupkaew_2015_63 traffickers have forced young people to drive ice cream trucks
NoyThrupkaew_2015_64 to sing in touring boys' choirs
NoyThrupkaew_2015_66 young families who were from ghana and togo and they told these families that your daughters are going to get a fine education in the united
NoyThrupkaew_2015_71 this is a huge problem so what have we done about it we've mostly turned to the criminal justice system
NoyThrupkaew_2015_73 and for populations like
NoyThrupkaew_2015_76 of the people in the sex trade who were surveyed said that they had been raped or assaulted by the police in the past year alone
NoyThrupkaew_2015_80 in case after case i've studied employers have no problem calling on law enforcement
NoyThrupkaew_2015_85 but out of an estimated twenty one million victims of human trafficking in the
NoyThrupkaew_2015_90 keep in mind that labor
NoyThrupkaew_2015_95 trafficking doesn't happen in a vacuum it happens in systematically degraded work environments
NoyThrupkaew_2015_96 you might be thinking oh she's talking about failed states or war torn states or i'm actually talking about the united states 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_99 involving hundreds of thai farm workers they were sent all over the states to work in hawaii pineapple plantations and washington apple orchards and anywhere the work was needed 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_101 so they made a calculated risk they sold their land they sold their wives' jewelry to make thousands in recruitment fees for this company global horizons 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_106 i was remembering the over the top meals the global horizons survivors would make for me every time i showed up to interview them
NoyThrupkaew_2015_107 finished one meal with this plate of perfect long stemmed strawberries and as they handed them to me they said
NoyThrupkaew_2015_112 so like the journalist i am i started digging into the agricultural sector 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_113 and i found there are too many fields and too few labor inspectors
NoyThrupkaew_2015_114 i found multiple layers of plausible deniability between grower and distributor and processor
NoyThrupkaew_2015_115 god knows who else
NoyThrupkaew_2015_117 that guest worker program ties a person's legal status to his or her employer and denies that worker the right to organize 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_120 and i would argue this is fertile ground for exploitation
NoyThrupkaew_2015_121 and all of this had been hidden to me before i had tried to understand it
NoyThrupkaew_2015_122 i wasn't the only person grappling with these issues pierre omidyar founder of ebay is one of the biggest anti trafficking philanthropists
NoyThrupkaew_2015_123 even he wound up accidentally investing nearly ten million dollars in the pineapple plantation cited as having the worst working conditions in that global horizons case
NoyThrupkaew_2015_124 when he found out he and his wife were shocked and horrified and they wound up writing an op ed for a newspaper saying that it was up to all of us to learn everything we can about the labor and supply chains of the products that we support
NoyThrupkaew_2015_128 if all the ceos out there decided that they were going to go through their
NoyThrupkaew_2015_133 we often dwell on human trafficking survivors' victimization 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_137 especially trafficking survivors
NoyThrupkaew_2015_138 these people were the most resourceful and resilient and responsible in their communities 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_139 they were the people that you would take a gamble on you'd say i'm gong to sell my rings because i have the chance to send you off to a better future 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_140 they were the emissaries of hope
NoyThrupkaew_2015_141 survivors don't need saving 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_143 the nannies and housekeepers who marched with their families and their employers' families their activism got us an international treaty on domestic workers
NoyThrupkaew_2015_144 the nepali women who were trafficked into the sex trade
NoyThrupkaew_2015_146 these indian shipyard workers were trafficked to do post hurricane katrina reconstruction
NoyThrupkaew_2015_147 they were threatened with deportation but they broke out of their work compound and they marched from new orleans to washington d c to protest labor
NoyThrupkaew_2015_148 exploitation they cofounded an organization called the national guest worker alliance and through this organization they have wound up helping other workers
NoyThrupkaew_2015_150 a team of civil rights lawyers won the first of a dozen civil suits this
NoyThrupkaew_2015_153 other workers and for the possibility of a just world for all of us
NoyThrupkaew_2015_158 and that we have the power to make a different choice 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_162 because like many a journalist i am far more interested in learning about your stories than sharing much if anything about my own 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_165 and of her life now
NoyThrupkaew_2015_168 we are all implicated in this problem
NoyThrupkaew_2015_171 to build a more just world is our work to do and our story to tell
