NoyThrupkaew_2015_0 ten years ago i went through a little bit of a hard time
NoyThrupkaew_2015_1 so i decided to go see a therapist i had been seeing her for a few months when she looked at me one day and said who actually raised you until you were three
NoyThrupkaew_2015_2 i don't think that's actually the case because if it were we'd be dealing with things that are far more complicated than just this it
NoyThrupkaew_2015_3 sounded like the setup to a joke but i knew she was serious 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_4 because when i first started seeing her i was trying to be the funniest person in the room and i would try and crack these jokes but she caught on to me really quickly 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_5 and whenever i tried to make a joke she would look at me and say
NoyThrupkaew_2015_6 that is actually really sad 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_7 so i knew i had to be serious and i asked my parents who had actually raised me until i was three and to my surprise they said
NoyThrupkaew_2015_8 my primary caregiver had been a distant relative of the family i had called her my auntie i remember my auntie so
NoyThrupkaew_2015_9 clearly it felt like she had been part of my life when i was much older 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_10 i remember the thick straight hair and how it would come around me like a curtain when she bent to pick me up
NoyThrupkaew_2015_11 her soft southern thai accent the way i would cling to her even if she just wanted to go to the bathroom or get something to eat
NoyThrupkaew_2015_12 i loved her but [ with ] the ferocity that a child has sometimes before she understands that love
NoyThrupkaew_2015_13 also requires letting go 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_14 but my clearest and sharpest memory of my auntie is also one of my first memories of life at all 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_15 i remember her being beaten and slapped by another member of my family 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_16 i remember screaming hysterically and wanting it to stop as i did every single time it happened for things as minor as wanting to go out with her
NoyThrupkaew_2015_17 friends or being a little late 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_18 i became so hysterical over her treatment that eventually she was just beaten behind closed doors
NoyThrupkaew_2015_19 things got so bad for her that eventually she ran away 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_20 as an adult i learned later that she had been just nineteen when she was brought over from thailand to the states to care for me on a tourist visa
NoyThrupkaew_2015_21 she wound up working in illinois for a time before eventually returning to thailand which is where i ran into her again at a political rally in bangkok 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_22 i clung to her again as i had when i was a child and i let go and then i promised that i would call 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_23 i never did though because i was afraid if i said everything that she meant to me
NoyThrupkaew_2015_24 that i owed perhaps the best parts of who i became to her care
NoyThrupkaew_2015_25 and that the words i'm sorry were like a thimble to bail out all the guilt and shame and rage i felt
NoyThrupkaew_2015_26 over everything she had endured to care for me for as long as she had
NoyThrupkaew_2015_27 i thought if i said those words to her i would never stop crying again
NoyThrupkaew_2015_28 had saved me and i had not saved her 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_29 i'm a journalist and i've been writing and researching human trafficking for the past eight years or so 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_30 and even so i never put together this personal story with my professional life until pretty
NoyThrupkaew_2015_31 i think this profound disconnect actually symbolizes most of our understanding about human trafficking 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_32 because human trafficking is far more prevalent complex and close to home than most of us realize 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_33 i spent time in jails and brothels interviewed hundreds of survivors and law enforcement ngo workers and when i think about what we've done about human trafficking
NoyThrupkaew_2015_34 partly because we don't even talk about the problem right at all
NoyThrupkaew_2015_35 when i say human trafficking most of you probably don't think about someone like my auntie
NoyThrupkaew_2015_36 you probably think about a young girl or woman who's been brutally forced into prostitution by a violent pimp 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_37 that is real suffering and that is a real story that story makes me angry for far more than just the reality of that situation
NoyThrupkaew_2015_38 as a journalist i really care about how we relate to each other through language and the way we tell that story with all the gory violent detail the salacious aspects
NoyThrupkaew_2015_39 i call that look at her scars journalism
NoyThrupkaew_2015_40 we use that story to convince ourselves that human trafficking is a bad man doing a bad thing to an innocent girl that story lets us off the hook
NoyThrupkaew_2015_41 it takes away all the societal context that we might be indicted for for the structural inequality or the poverty or the barriers to migration 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_42 we let ourselves think that human trafficking is only about forced prostitution 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_43 when in reality human trafficking is embedded in our everyday lives
NoyThrupkaew_2015_44 let me show you what i mean forced prostitution accounts for
NoyThrupkaew_2015_45 human trafficking 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_46 ten percent is in state imposed forced labor
NoyThrupkaew_2015_47 but a whopping sixty eight percent is for the purpose of creating the goods and delivering the services that most of us rely on every day
NoyThrupkaew_2015_48 in sectors like agricultural work domestic work and construction 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_49 that is food and care and shelter
NoyThrupkaew_2015_50 and somehow these most essential
NoyThrupkaew_2015_51 workers are also among the world's most underpaid and exploited today 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_52 human trafficking is the use of force fraud or coercion to compel another person's labor
NoyThrupkaew_2015_53 and it's found in cotton fields and coltan mines and even car washes in norway and england
NoyThrupkaew_2015_54 it's found in u s military bases in iraq and afghanistan it's found in thailand's fishing industry
NoyThrupkaew_2015_55 industry that country has become the largest exporter of shrimp in the world 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_56 but what are the circumstances behind all that cheap and plentiful shrimp
NoyThrupkaew_2015_57 thai military were caught selling burmese and cambodian migrants onto fishing boats
NoyThrupkaew_2015_58 those fishing boats were taken out the men put to work and they were thrown overboard if they made the mistake of falling sick or
NoyThrupkaew_2015_59 trying to resist their treatment 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_60 those fish were then used to feed shrimp the shrimp were then sold to four major global retailers 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_61 costco tesco walmart and carrefour
NoyThrupkaew_2015_62 human trafficking is found on a smaller scale than just that and in places you would never even imagine
NoyThrupkaew_2015_63 traffickers have forced young people to drive ice cream trucks
NoyThrupkaew_2015_64 to sing in touring boys' choirs
NoyThrupkaew_2015_65 trafficking has even been found in a hair braiding salon in new jersey the scheme in that case was incredible the traffickers found
NoyThrupkaew_2015_66 young families who were from ghana and togo and they told these families that your daughters are going to get a fine education in the united
NoyThrupkaew_2015_67 they then located winners of the green card lottery and they told them we'll help you out we'll get you a plane ticket we'll pay your fees
NoyThrupkaew_2015_68 all you have to do is take this young girl with you say that she's your sister or your spouse 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_69 once everyone arrived in new jersey the young girls were taken away and put to work for 14 hour days seven days a week for five years
NoyThrupkaew_2015_70 they made their traffickers nearly four million dollars
NoyThrupkaew_2015_71 this is a huge problem so what have we done about it we've mostly turned to the criminal justice system
NoyThrupkaew_2015_72 but keep in mind most victims of human trafficking are poor and marginalized they're migrants people of color sometimes they're in the sex trade 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_73 and for populations like
NoyThrupkaew_2015_74 criminal justice system is too often part of the problem rather than the solution
NoyThrupkaew_2015_75 in study after study in countries ranging from bangladesh to the united states between twenty and sixty percent
NoyThrupkaew_2015_76 of the people in the sex trade who were surveyed said that they had been raped or assaulted by the police in the past year alone
NoyThrupkaew_2015_77 people in prostitution including people who have been trafficked into it regularly receive multiple convictions for prostitution
NoyThrupkaew_2015_78 having that criminal record makes it so much more difficult to leave poverty leave abuse or leave prostitution if that person so desires
NoyThrupkaew_2015_79 workers outside of the sex sector if they try and resist their treatment they risk deportation
NoyThrupkaew_2015_80 in case after case i've studied employers have no problem calling on law enforcement
NoyThrupkaew_2015_81 to try and threaten or deport their striking trafficked
NoyThrupkaew_2015_82 workers
NoyThrupkaew_2015_83 if those workers run away they risk becoming part of the great mass of undocumented workers who are also subject to the whims of law enforcement if they're caught
NoyThrupkaew_2015_84 law enforcement is supposed to identify victims and prosecute traffickers
NoyThrupkaew_2015_85 but out of an estimated twenty one million victims of human trafficking in the
NoyThrupkaew_2015_86 world they have helped and identified fewer than fifty thousand people that's like comparing
NoyThrupkaew_2015_87 the population of the world to the population of los angeles proportionally speaking
NoyThrupkaew_2015_88 as for convictions
NoyThrupkaew_2015_89 out of an estimated five thousand seven hundred convictions in two thousand and thirteen fewer than five hundred were for labor trafficking
NoyThrupkaew_2015_90 keep in mind that labor
NoyThrupkaew_2015_91 trafficking accounts for sixty eight percent of all trafficking but fewer than ten percent of the convictions
NoyThrupkaew_2015_92 i've heard one expert say that trafficking happens where need meets greed
NoyThrupkaew_2015_93 i'd like to add one more element to that
NoyThrupkaew_2015_94 trafficking happens in sectors where workers are excluded from protections and denied the right to organize
NoyThrupkaew_2015_95 trafficking doesn't happen in a vacuum it happens in systematically degraded work environments
NoyThrupkaew_2015_96 you might be thinking oh she's talking about failed states or war torn states or i'm actually talking about the united states 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_97 let me tell you what that looks like
NoyThrupkaew_2015_98 i spent many months researching a trafficking case called global
NoyThrupkaew_2015_99 involving hundreds of thai farm workers they were sent all over the states to work in hawaii pineapple plantations and washington apple orchards and anywhere the work was needed 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_100 they were promised three years of solid agricultural work
NoyThrupkaew_2015_101 so they made a calculated risk they sold their land they sold their wives' jewelry to make thousands in recruitment fees for this company global horizons 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_102 they were brought over
NoyThrupkaew_2015_103 their passports were confiscated some of the men were beaten and held at gunpoint they worked so hard they fainted in the fields 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_104 this case hit me so hard
NoyThrupkaew_2015_105 after i came back home i was wandering through the grocery store and i froze in the produce department 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_106 i was remembering the over the top meals the global horizons survivors would make for me every time i showed up to interview them
NoyThrupkaew_2015_107 finished one meal with this plate of perfect long stemmed strawberries and as they handed them to me they said
NoyThrupkaew_2015_108 aren't these the kind of strawberries you eat with somebody special in the states 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_109 and don't they taste so much better when you know the people whose hands picked them for you
NoyThrupkaew_2015_110 as i stood in that grocery store weeks later i realized i had no idea
NoyThrupkaew_2015_111 of who to thank for this plenty and no idea of how they were being treated
NoyThrupkaew_2015_112 so like the journalist i am i started digging into the agricultural sector 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_113 and i found there are too many fields and too few labor inspectors
NoyThrupkaew_2015_114 i found multiple layers of plausible deniability between grower and distributor and processor
NoyThrupkaew_2015_115 god knows who else
NoyThrupkaew_2015_116 the global horizons survivors had been brought to the states on a temporary guest worker program
NoyThrupkaew_2015_117 that guest worker program ties a person's legal status to his or her employer and denies that worker the right to organize 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_118 mind you none of what i am describing about this agricultural sector or the guest worker program is actually
NoyThrupkaew_2015_119 is merely what we find legally tolerable 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_120 and i would argue this is fertile ground for exploitation
NoyThrupkaew_2015_121 and all of this had been hidden to me before i had tried to understand it
NoyThrupkaew_2015_122 i wasn't the only person grappling with these issues pierre omidyar founder of ebay is one of the biggest anti trafficking philanthropists
NoyThrupkaew_2015_123 even he wound up accidentally investing nearly ten million dollars in the pineapple plantation cited as having the worst working conditions in that global horizons case
NoyThrupkaew_2015_124 when he found out he and his wife were shocked and horrified and they wound up writing an op ed for a newspaper saying that it was up to all of us to learn everything we can about the labor and supply chains of the products that we support
NoyThrupkaew_2015_125 totally agree
NoyThrupkaew_2015_126 what would happen if each one of us decided that we are no longer going to support companies if they don't eliminate exploitation from their labor and supply chains
NoyThrupkaew_2015_127 if we demanded laws calling for the same 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_128 if all the ceos out there decided that they were going to go through their
NoyThrupkaew_2015_129 if we ended recruitment fees for migrant workers if we decided that guest workers should have the right to organize without fear of retaliation 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_130 these would be decisions heard around the world 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_131 this isn't a matter of buying a fair trade peach and calling it a day buying a guilt free zone with your money that's not how it works
NoyThrupkaew_2015_132 this is the decision to change a system that is broken and that we have unwittingly but willingly allowed ourselves to profit from and benefit from for too long
NoyThrupkaew_2015_133 we often dwell on human trafficking survivors' victimization 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_134 but that is not my experience of them
NoyThrupkaew_2015_135 over all the years that i've been talking to them they have
NoyThrupkaew_2015_136 taught me that we are more than our worst days each one of us is more than what we have lived through
NoyThrupkaew_2015_137 especially trafficking survivors
NoyThrupkaew_2015_138 these people were the most resourceful and resilient and responsible in their communities 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_139 they were the people that you would take a gamble on you'd say i'm gong to sell my rings because i have the chance to send you off to a better future 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_140 they were the emissaries of hope
NoyThrupkaew_2015_141 survivors don't need saving 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_142 they need solidarity because they're behind some of the most exciting social justice movements out there today 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_143 the nannies and housekeepers who marched with their families and their employers' families their activism got us an international treaty on domestic workers
NoyThrupkaew_2015_144 the nepali women who were trafficked into the sex trade
NoyThrupkaew_2015_145 they came together and they decided that they were going to make the world's first anti trafficking organization actually headed and run by trafficking survivors themselves
NoyThrupkaew_2015_146 these indian shipyard workers were trafficked to do post hurricane katrina reconstruction
NoyThrupkaew_2015_147 they were threatened with deportation but they broke out of their work compound and they marched from new orleans to washington d c to protest labor
NoyThrupkaew_2015_148 exploitation they cofounded an organization called the national guest worker alliance and through this organization they have wound up helping other workers
NoyThrupkaew_2015_149 bring to light exploitation and abuses in supply chains in walmart and hershey's factories and although the department of justice declined to take their case
NoyThrupkaew_2015_150 a team of civil rights lawyers won the first of a dozen civil suits this
NoyThrupkaew_2015_151 february and got their clients fourteen million dollars
NoyThrupkaew_2015_152 these survivors are fighting for people they don't even know yet 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_153 other workers and for the possibility of a just world for all of us
NoyThrupkaew_2015_154 this is our chance to do the same 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_155 this is our chance to make the decision that tells us who we are as a people and as a society that our prosperity
NoyThrupkaew_2015_156 is no longer prosperity as long as it is pinned to other people's pain 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_157 that our lives are inextricably woven together 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_158 and that we have the power to make a different choice 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_159 i was so reluctant
NoyThrupkaew_2015_160 to share my story of my auntie with you before i started this ted process and climbed up on this stage
NoyThrupkaew_2015_161 told literally a handful of people about it
NoyThrupkaew_2015_162 because like many a journalist i am far more interested in learning about your stories than sharing much if anything about my own 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_163 i also haven't done my journalistic due diligence on this i haven't issued my mountains of document requests and interviewed everyone and their mother 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_164 and i haven't found my auntie yet i don't know her story of what happened
NoyThrupkaew_2015_165 and of her life now
NoyThrupkaew_2015_166 the story as i've told it to you is messy and unfinished 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_167 but i think it mirrors the messy and unfinished situation we're all in when it comes to human trafficking 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_168 we are all implicated in this problem
NoyThrupkaew_2015_169 but that means we are all also part of its solution 
NoyThrupkaew_2015_170 figuring out
NoyThrupkaew_2015_171 to build a more just world is our work to do and our story to tell
NoyThrupkaew_2015_172 so let us tell it the way we should have done from the very beginning let us tell this story together thank you so much
