RichardPreston_2008_2 the range of the species goes up to as much as three hundred and eighty feet tall that's thirty eight stories tall these are trees that would stand out in midtown manhattan
RichardPreston_2008_6 the north coast of california where the rain is really intense
RichardPreston_2008_7 in recent historic times about ninety six percent of the coast redwood forest was cut down especially in a series 
RichardPreston_2008_8 of bursts of intense liquidation logging clear cutting that took place in the
RichardPreston_2008_10 entirely protected in a chain of small parks strung out like pearls along the north coast of california including redwood national park 
RichardPreston_2008_11 but curiously
RichardPreston_2008_13 redwood rainforest is incredibly difficult to move through
RichardPreston_2008_14 and even today individual trees are being discovered that have never been seen before including in the summer of two thousand and six hyperion the world's tallest tree 
RichardPreston_2008_17 it's a kind loaner from ted 
RichardPreston_2008_18 and chris if you could take the end of that tape measure we
RichardPreston_2008_21 tape chris could you extend your arm out that way there we go ok and
RichardPreston_2008_22 maybe about here about thirty feet is the diameter of a big redwood
RichardPreston_2008_23 now let your imagination go upward into space think about this tree 
RichardPreston_2008_25 the redwood species seems to exist in another kind of time not human time but what we might call redwood time 
RichardPreston_2008_27 moves at a more stately pace than human time
RichardPreston_2008_30 articulating themselves and filling redwood space over redwood time over thousands of years plant this small seed wait two thousand years and you get this the lost monarch it dwells in the grove of
RichardPreston_2008_32 're like a mouse looking at the foot of an elephant and most of the organism is overhead unseen
RichardPreston_2008_40 until he got to the top of the tree his friend a guy named marwood
RichardPreston_2008_41 neither one of them had noticed that there was a yellow jacket wasp's nest the size of a bowling ball hanging from the branch that steve had jumped into and when marwood made the jump he was covered with wasps
RichardPreston_2008_46 after three books on this it got to be a bit much in a way
RichardPreston_2008_47 my wife and i adore our
RichardPreston_2008_48 i began climbing trees with my kids as
RichardPreston_2008_49 as just something to do with them using the so called arborist climbing technique with ropes you use ropes to get yourself up into the crown of a tree children are incredibly adept at climbing trees that's my son oliver 
RichardPreston_2008_54 are afraid of heights all other primates when they're scared they run up a tree where they feel safe
RichardPreston_2008_57 looking out of a tree boat in the morning and hearing birdsong coming in three dimensions around us we had been visited in the night by flying squirrels who don't seem to recognize humans for what they are because they've never seen them in the canopy before 
RichardPreston_2008_60 it became a writing project when steve sillett gets up into a big redwood he fires an arrow which trails a fishing line which gets over a branch in the tree and then you ascend up a rope which has been dragged into the tree by the line
RichardPreston_2008_65 filled with hanging gardens of ferns growing out of soil which is populated with all kinds of small organisms
RichardPreston_2008_66 there are epiphytes plants that grow on trees these are huckleberry bushes many species of mosses and then all sorts of lichens just plastering the tree 
RichardPreston_2008_69 you're going upward instead of downward and then the trees tend to flare out into platform like areas at the top maria's sitting on one of them these limbs could be five to six hundred years old redwoods grow very slowly in their tops
RichardPreston_2008_72 redwoods have an enormous surface area that extends upward into space because they have a propensity to do something called reiteration
RichardPreston_2008_73 a redwood is a fractal and as they put out limbs
RichardPreston_2008_76 one of the older redwoods this reiteration is a huge flying buttress that comes out the tree itself
RichardPreston_2008_77 this buttress is less than halfway up the tree
RichardPreston_2008_84 if it would be possible to insert a synthetic chromosome into a human so that we could reiterate ourselves if we wanted to and if we were able to reiterate then the fingers of our hand would be people
RichardPreston_2008_88 laughter to reiterate the point
RichardPreston_2008_89 let's go closer into iluvatar 
RichardPreston_2008_90 we're looking at that yellow box and this hallucinatory drawing shows you everything you see in this drawing is iluvatar
RichardPreston_2008_94 flying buttresses just as in a cathedral help strengthen the crown of the tree and help the tree exist longer through time 
RichardPreston_2008_96 they're finding out that redwoods can move moisture out of the air and down into their trunks possibly all the way into their root systems they also have the ability to put roots anywhere 
RichardPreston_2008_98 got a touch of gangrene in our arm then we could just you know extract the nutrients extract the nutrients and the moisture out of it until it fell off
RichardPreston_2008_99 canopy soil can occur up to a meter deep
RichardPreston_2008_100 hundreds of feet above the ground and there are organisms in this soil that have as yet no names this is an unnamed species of
RichardPreston_2008_102 of the oceans and they are a major part of the diet of grazing baleen whales what they're doing in in the redwood forest canopy soil hundreds of feet above the ocean or how they got there
RichardPreston_2008_106 which is thought to be the oldest redwood gaya may be three thousand to five thousand years old no one really knows but its top has broken off and it's been rotting back now this little japanese garden like
RichardPreston_2008_107 creation
RichardPreston_2008_109 it takes a magnifying glass to see a giant tree 
RichardPreston_2008_110 i have to show you something unfortunately very sad at the conclusion of this talk 
RichardPreston_2008_111 the eastern hemlock tree has often been described as the redwood of the east and we're moving in a full circle now in the 
RichardPreston_2008_114 its new host the eastern hemlock tree it escaped its predators and the new tree had no resistance to it the eastern hemlock forest is being considered in some 
RichardPreston_2008_121 i climbed there this past summer this is great smoky mountains national park and the hemlocks are dead as far as the eye can see 
RichardPreston_2008_125 i almost can't conceive it is the idea that the national news media hasn't picked this up at all and this is the devastation of one of the most important ecosystems in north america
RichardPreston_2008_128 and the brevity of human life the necessity to love 
RichardPreston_2008_129 but we're different from trees and they can also teach us something about ourselves in the differences that we have we are human and we have the capacity to
RichardPreston_2008_130 love we have the capacity to wonder and we have a sort of boundless curiosity
RichardPreston_2008_131 a restless inquisitiveness that so suits us as primates i think
RichardPreston_2008_134 and i think that one of the happiest things is the sense that
RichardPreston_2008_135 that with my children i've been able to introduce them into the very small circle of humans who
RichardPreston_2008_138 i mentioned hyperion the world's tallest tree
RichardPreston_2008_139 and i was a member of a climbing team that made the first climb of it in two thousand and six and while we were climbing hyperion marie antoine
RichardPreston_2008_147 ecosystems gone forever it
RichardPreston_2008_148 's an amazing sense of wonder you've given me and a sense of just how fragile this this whole thing is rp it is fragile and you know i think about emerging human diseases
RichardPreston_2008_152 but lately
