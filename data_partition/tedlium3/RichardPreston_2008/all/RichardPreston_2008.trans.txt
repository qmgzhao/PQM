RichardPreston_2008_0 rainforests temperate rainforests where it can rain more than one hundred inches a year this is the realm of the coast redwood tree
RichardPreston_2008_1 its species name is sequoia sempervirens sequoia sempervirens is the tallest living organism on earth
RichardPreston_2008_2 the range of the species goes up to as much as three hundred and eighty feet tall that's thirty eight stories tall these are trees that would stand out in midtown manhattan
RichardPreston_2008_3 nobody knows how old the oldest living coast redwoods are because nobody has ever drilled into any
RichardPreston_2008_4 them to count their annual growth rings and in any case the centers of the oldest individuals appear to be hollow but it's believed that the oldest living redwoods are 
RichardPreston_2008_5 perhaps two thousand five hundred years old roughly the age of the parthenon
RichardPreston_2008_6 the north coast of california where the rain is really intense
RichardPreston_2008_7 in recent historic times about ninety six percent of the coast redwood forest was cut down especially in a series 
RichardPreston_2008_8 of bursts of intense liquidation logging clear cutting that took place in the
RichardPreston_2008_9 about four percent of the primeval redwood rainforest remains intact wild and now protected
RichardPreston_2008_10 entirely protected in a chain of small parks strung out like pearls along the north coast of california including redwood national park 
RichardPreston_2008_11 but curiously
RichardPreston_2008_12 the fragments that we have left to this day remain
RichardPreston_2008_13 redwood rainforest is incredibly difficult to move through
RichardPreston_2008_14 and even today individual trees are being discovered that have never been seen before including in the summer of two thousand and six hyperion the world's tallest tree 
RichardPreston_2008_15 i'm going to do a little gedanken experiment i'm going to ask you to imagine what a redwood really is as a living organism and chris if i could have you up
RichardPreston_2008_16 here i have a tape measure
RichardPreston_2008_17 it's a kind loaner from ted 
RichardPreston_2008_18 and chris if you could take the end of that tape measure we
RichardPreston_2008_19 're going to show you what the diameter at breast height of a big redwood is unfortunately
RichardPreston_2008_20 this tape isn't long enough it's only
RichardPreston_2008_21 tape chris could you extend your arm out that way there we go ok and
RichardPreston_2008_22 maybe about here about thirty feet is the diameter of a big redwood
RichardPreston_2008_23 now let your imagination go upward into space think about this tree 
RichardPreston_2008_24 an individual living organism articulating its forms upward into space over long periods of time 
RichardPreston_2008_25 the redwood species seems to exist in another kind of time not human time but what we might call redwood time 
RichardPreston_2008_26 redwood time
RichardPreston_2008_27 moves at a more stately pace than human time
RichardPreston_2008_28 to us when we look at a redwood tree it seems to be motionless and still and yet redwoods are constantly in motion
RichardPreston_2008_29 moving upward into space 
RichardPreston_2008_30 articulating themselves and filling redwood space over redwood time over thousands of years plant this small seed wait two thousand years and you get this the lost monarch it dwells in the grove of
RichardPreston_2008_31 titans on the north coast and was discovered in one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight and yet when you look at the base of a redwood tree you're not seeing the organism you
RichardPreston_2008_32 're like a mouse looking at the foot of an elephant and most of the organism is overhead unseen
RichardPreston_2008_33 i became very interested and i wrote about
RichardPreston_2008_34 a couple steve sillett and marie antoine are the principal explorers of the redwood forest canopy
RichardPreston_2008_35 also are world class forest ecology scientists
RichardPreston_2008_36 steve sillett when he was a 19 year old college student at reed college
RichardPreston_2008_37 had heard that the redwood forest canopy is considered to be a so called redwood desert that is to say at that time it was believed that there was nothing up there except the branches of redwood trees
RichardPreston_2008_38 and with a friend of his he took it upon himself to free climb a redwood without ropes or any equipment to see what was up there he climbed up a small tree next to this giant redwood and then
RichardPreston_2008_39 he leaped through space and grabbed a branch with his hands and ended up hanging like catching a bar of a trapeze and then from there he climbed directly up the bark
RichardPreston_2008_40 until he got to the top of the tree his friend a guy named marwood
RichardPreston_2008_41 neither one of them had noticed that there was a yellow jacket wasp's nest the size of a bowling ball hanging from the branch that steve had jumped into and when marwood made the jump he was covered with wasps
RichardPreston_2008_42 stinging him in the face and eyes he nearly let go
RichardPreston_2008_43 he would have fallen to his death being seventy five feet above the ground but they made it to the top and what they found was not a redwood desert but a lost world a kind of three dimensional labyrinth in the air filled
RichardPreston_2008_44 with unknown life now i had been working on other topics the emergence of infectious diseases
RichardPreston_2008_45 which come out of the natural ecosystems of the earth make a trans species jump and get into humans 
RichardPreston_2008_46 after three books on this it got to be a bit much in a way
RichardPreston_2008_47 my wife and i adore our
RichardPreston_2008_48 i began climbing trees with my kids as
RichardPreston_2008_49 as just something to do with them using the so called arborist climbing technique with ropes you use ropes to get yourself up into the crown of a tree children are incredibly adept at climbing trees that's my son oliver 
RichardPreston_2008_50 they don't seem to suffer from the same fear of heights that humans do
RichardPreston_2008_51 if ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny then children are somewhat closer to our roots as primates in the arboreal forest
RichardPreston_2008_52 humans appear to be the only primates that i know of
RichardPreston_2008_53 that
RichardPreston_2008_54 are afraid of heights all other primates when they're scared they run up a tree where they feel safe
RichardPreston_2008_55 we camped overnight in the trees in tree boats this is my daughter laura then fifteen looking out of a tree boat she's by the way tied in with a rope
RichardPreston_2008_56 so she can't fall
RichardPreston_2008_57 looking out of a tree boat in the morning and hearing birdsong coming in three dimensions around us we had been visited in the night by flying squirrels who don't seem to recognize humans for what they are because they've never seen them in the canopy before 
RichardPreston_2008_58 and we practiced advanced techniques like sky walking where you can move from
RichardPreston_2008_59 tree to tree through space rather like spiderman 
RichardPreston_2008_60 it became a writing project when steve sillett gets up into a big redwood he fires an arrow which trails a fishing line which gets over a branch in the tree and then you ascend up a rope which has been dragged into the tree by the line
RichardPreston_2008_61 you ascend thirty stories there are two people climbing this tree gaya which is thought to be one of the oldest redwoods there they are they are
RichardPreston_2008_62 of the way up that tree 
RichardPreston_2008_63 you do feel a sense of exposure there is a small person right down there on the ground you feel like you're climbing a wall of wood but then you enter the redwood canopy and 
RichardPreston_2008_64 it's like coming through a layer of clouds and all of a sudden you lose sight of the ground and you also lose sight of the sky and you're in a three dimensional labyrinth in the air 
RichardPreston_2008_65 filled with hanging gardens of ferns growing out of soil which is populated with all kinds of small organisms
RichardPreston_2008_66 there are epiphytes plants that grow on trees these are huckleberry bushes many species of mosses and then all sorts of lichens just plastering the tree 
RichardPreston_2008_67 when you get near the top of the tree 
RichardPreston_2008_68 you feel like you can't fall in fact it's difficult to move you're worming your way through branches which are crowded with living things that don't occur near the ground it's like scuba diving into a coral reef
RichardPreston_2008_69 you're going upward instead of downward and then the trees tend to flare out into platform like areas at the top maria's sitting on one of them these limbs could be five to six hundred years old redwoods grow very slowly in their tops
RichardPreston_2008_70 they also have a feature thickets of huckleberry bushes that grow out of the tops of redwood trees that are technically known as huckleberry
RichardPreston_2008_71 and you can sit there and snack on the berries while you're resting
RichardPreston_2008_72 redwoods have an enormous surface area that extends upward into space because they have a propensity to do something called reiteration
RichardPreston_2008_73 a redwood is a fractal and as they put out limbs
RichardPreston_2008_74 the limbs burst into small trees copies of the redwood
RichardPreston_2008_75 now here we see a reiteration in
RichardPreston_2008_76 one of the older redwoods this reiteration is a huge flying buttress that comes out the tree itself
RichardPreston_2008_77 this buttress is less than halfway up the tree
RichardPreston_2008_78 and then it bursts into a forest of redwoods this particular extra trunk
RichardPreston_2008_79 is a meter across at the base and extends upward for one hundred and fifty feet it's as big as any of the biggest trees east of the mississippi river and yet it's only
RichardPreston_2008_80 of the crown structure of a redwood named iluvatar made by steve sillett marie antoine and their colleagues gives you an idea what you're seeing here is a hierarchical 
RichardPreston_2008_81 schematic development of the trunks of this tree as it has elaborated itself over time into six layers of fractal of trunks springing from trunks springing from trunks 
RichardPreston_2008_82 to give a sense of scale
RichardPreston_2008_83 there's the person right there the person is waving to us i've wanted to ask craig venter
RichardPreston_2008_84 if it would be possible to insert a synthetic chromosome into a human so that we could reiterate ourselves if we wanted to and if we were able to reiterate then the fingers of our hand would be people
RichardPreston_2008_85 who looked like us 
RichardPreston_2008_86 and they would have people on their hands and so on and if we had redwood like biology we would have six layers of people on our hands as it were and it would be a lovely thing to 
RichardPreston_2008_87 be able to wave to someone and have all our reiterations wave at the same time
RichardPreston_2008_88 laughter to reiterate the point
RichardPreston_2008_89 let's go closer into iluvatar 
RichardPreston_2008_90 we're looking at that yellow box and this hallucinatory drawing shows you everything you see in this drawing is iluvatar
RichardPreston_2008_91 these are millennial structures portions of the tree that are believed to be more than one thousand years old there are four humans in this shot one two
RichardPreston_2008_92 and there's also something that i want to show you this is a flying buttress
RichardPreston_2008_93 redwoods grow back into themselves as they expand into space and this flying buttress is a limb shot out of that small trunk going back into the main trunk and fusing with it
RichardPreston_2008_94 flying buttresses just as in a cathedral help strengthen the crown of the tree and help the tree exist longer through time 
RichardPreston_2008_95 wired them like patients in 
RichardPreston_2008_96 they're finding out that redwoods can move moisture out of the air and down into their trunks possibly all the way into their root systems they also have the ability to put roots anywhere 
RichardPreston_2008_97 in the tree itself if a portion of a redwood is rotting the redwood will send roots into its own form and draw nutrients out of itself as it falls apart
RichardPreston_2008_98 got a touch of gangrene in our arm then we could just you know extract the nutrients extract the nutrients and the moisture out of it until it fell off
RichardPreston_2008_99 canopy soil can occur up to a meter deep
RichardPreston_2008_100 hundreds of feet above the ground and there are organisms in this soil that have as yet no names this is an unnamed species of
RichardPreston_2008_101 a copepod is a crustacean these copepods are a major constituent
RichardPreston_2008_102 of the oceans and they are a major part of the diet of grazing baleen whales what they're doing in in the redwood forest canopy soil hundreds of feet above the ocean or how they got there
RichardPreston_2008_103 is completely unknown
RichardPreston_2008_104 there are some interesting theories that if i had time i would tell you about but as you go and you look closer at a tree what you see is you see increasing complexity
RichardPreston_2008_105 're looking at the very top of gaya
RichardPreston_2008_106 which is thought to be the oldest redwood gaya may be three thousand to five thousand years old no one really knows but its top has broken off and it's been rotting back now this little japanese garden like
RichardPreston_2008_107 creation
RichardPreston_2008_108 probably took seven hundred years to form in its complexity that we see right now as you look at a tree
RichardPreston_2008_109 it takes a magnifying glass to see a giant tree 
RichardPreston_2008_110 i have to show you something unfortunately very sad at the conclusion of this talk 
RichardPreston_2008_111 the eastern hemlock tree has often been described as the redwood of the east and we're moving in a full circle now in the 
RichardPreston_2008_112 a small organism appeared in richmond virginia 
RichardPreston_2008_113 called the hemlock woolly adelgid it made a trans species jump out of some other organism in asia where it was living on hemlock trees in asia when it moved into 
RichardPreston_2008_114 its new host the eastern hemlock tree it escaped its predators and the new tree had no resistance to it the eastern hemlock forest is being considered in some 
RichardPreston_2008_115 ways the last fragments of primeval rainforest east of the mississippi river i hadn't even known that there were rainforests in the east but in great smoky
RichardPreston_2008_116 mountains national park
RichardPreston_2008_117 it can rain up to one hundred inches of rain a year
RichardPreston_2008_118 and in the last two to three summers
RichardPreston_2008_119 these invasive organisms this kind of ebola of the trees as it were has swept through the primeval hemlock forest of
RichardPreston_2008_120 and has absolutely wiped it out
RichardPreston_2008_121 i climbed there this past summer this is great smoky mountains national park and the hemlocks are dead as far as the eye can see 
RichardPreston_2008_122 and what we're seeing is not just the potential death of the eastern hemlock species that is to say its extinction from nature due to this invading parasite but we're also seeing the death
RichardPreston_2008_123 for which these trees are merely the substrate for the aerial
RichardPreston_2008_124 labyrinth of the sky that exists in their crowns it's absolutely heartbreaking to see one of the things that is just
RichardPreston_2008_125 i almost can't conceive it is the idea that the national news media hasn't picked this up at all and this is the devastation of one of the most important ecosystems in north america
RichardPreston_2008_126 what can the redwoods tell us about ourselves well i think they can tell us something about human time the flickering
RichardPreston_2008_127 transitory quality of human time
RichardPreston_2008_128 and the brevity of human life the necessity to love 
RichardPreston_2008_129 but we're different from trees and they can also teach us something about ourselves in the differences that we have we are human and we have the capacity to
RichardPreston_2008_130 love we have the capacity to wonder and we have a sort of boundless curiosity
RichardPreston_2008_131 a restless inquisitiveness that so suits us as primates i think
RichardPreston_2008_132 and at least for me personally the trees have taught me an entirely new way of loving my children 
RichardPreston_2008_133 exploring with them the forest canopy has been one of the most lovely things of my existence on earth
RichardPreston_2008_134 and i think that one of the happiest things is the sense that
RichardPreston_2008_135 that with my children i've been able to introduce them into the very small circle of humans who
RichardPreston_2008_136 are lucky enough or possibly stupid enough to still climb trees thank you very much
RichardPreston_2008_137 it was nathan myhrvold who told me that it was thought that because these trees are like two thousand years and older on many of them there are ecosystems where there are species that are not found anywhere on the earth except on that one
RichardPreston_2008_138 i mentioned hyperion the world's tallest tree
RichardPreston_2008_139 and i was a member of a climbing team that made the first climb of it in two thousand and six and while we were climbing hyperion marie antoine
RichardPreston_2008_140 spotted an unknown species of golden brown ant about halfway up the trunk 
RichardPreston_2008_141 ants are not known to occur in redwood trees curiously enough 
RichardPreston_2008_142 and we wondered whether this ant this species of ant was only endemic to that one tree
RichardPreston_2008_143 possibly to that grove and in subsequent climbs they could never find that ant again and so no specimens have ever been collected we don't know what it is we just know it's there ca
RichardPreston_2008_144 so you have to wonder when you know if some other
RichardPreston_2008_145 species than us was recording the stories that mattered on earth you know
RichardPreston_2008_146 our stories are about iraq and war and politics and celebrity gossip you've just told us a different story of this this tragic arms race that's happening and maybe whole
RichardPreston_2008_147 ecosystems gone forever it
RichardPreston_2008_148 's an amazing sense of wonder you've given me and a sense of just how fragile this this whole thing is rp it is fragile and you know i think about emerging human diseases
RichardPreston_2008_149 parasites that move into the human species but that's just a very small facet of a much greater problem of invasions of species
RichardPreston_2008_150 worldwide all through the ecosystems and you know the earth itself ca partly caused by us inadvertently rp caused by humans caused by the movement of humans
RichardPreston_2008_151 you can think of the earth's biosphere as a palace and the continents are rooms in the palace and the islands are small rooms
RichardPreston_2008_152 but lately 
RichardPreston_2008_153 the doors of the palace have been flung open and the walls are coming down ca
RichardPreston_2008_154 richard preston thank you very much i think
