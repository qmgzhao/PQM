RichardPreston_2008_0 rainforests temperate rainforests where it can rain more than one hundred inches a year this is the realm of the coast redwood tree
RichardPreston_2008_1 its species name is sequoia sempervirens sequoia sempervirens is the tallest living organism on earth
RichardPreston_2008_5 perhaps two thousand five hundred years old roughly the age of the parthenon
RichardPreston_2008_9 about four percent of the primeval redwood rainforest remains intact wild and now protected
RichardPreston_2008_12 the fragments that we have left to this day remain
RichardPreston_2008_15 i'm going to do a little gedanken experiment i'm going to ask you to imagine what a redwood really is as a living organism and chris if i could have you up
RichardPreston_2008_24 an individual living organism articulating its forms upward into space over long periods of time 
RichardPreston_2008_26 redwood time
RichardPreston_2008_31 titans on the north coast and was discovered in one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight and yet when you look at the base of a redwood tree you're not seeing the organism you
RichardPreston_2008_33 i became very interested and i wrote about
RichardPreston_2008_34 a couple steve sillett and marie antoine are the principal explorers of the redwood forest canopy
RichardPreston_2008_35 also are world class forest ecology scientists
RichardPreston_2008_36 steve sillett when he was a 19 year old college student at reed college
RichardPreston_2008_37 had heard that the redwood forest canopy is considered to be a so called redwood desert that is to say at that time it was believed that there was nothing up there except the branches of redwood trees
RichardPreston_2008_38 and with a friend of his he took it upon himself to free climb a redwood without ropes or any equipment to see what was up there he climbed up a small tree next to this giant redwood and then
RichardPreston_2008_42 stinging him in the face and eyes he nearly let go
RichardPreston_2008_43 he would have fallen to his death being seventy five feet above the ground but they made it to the top and what they found was not a redwood desert but a lost world a kind of three dimensional labyrinth in the air filled
RichardPreston_2008_44 with unknown life now i had been working on other topics the emergence of infectious diseases
RichardPreston_2008_45 which come out of the natural ecosystems of the earth make a trans species jump and get into humans 
RichardPreston_2008_50 they don't seem to suffer from the same fear of heights that humans do
RichardPreston_2008_51 if ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny then children are somewhat closer to our roots as primates in the arboreal forest
RichardPreston_2008_52 humans appear to be the only primates that i know of
RichardPreston_2008_55 we camped overnight in the trees in tree boats this is my daughter laura then fifteen looking out of a tree boat she's by the way tied in with a rope
RichardPreston_2008_56 so she can't fall
RichardPreston_2008_58 and we practiced advanced techniques like sky walking where you can move from
RichardPreston_2008_61 you ascend thirty stories there are two people climbing this tree gaya which is thought to be one of the oldest redwoods there they are they are
RichardPreston_2008_64 it's like coming through a layer of clouds and all of a sudden you lose sight of the ground and you also lose sight of the sky and you're in a three dimensional labyrinth in the air 
RichardPreston_2008_67 when you get near the top of the tree 
RichardPreston_2008_74 the limbs burst into small trees copies of the redwood
RichardPreston_2008_78 and then it bursts into a forest of redwoods this particular extra trunk
RichardPreston_2008_79 is a meter across at the base and extends upward for one hundred and fifty feet it's as big as any of the biggest trees east of the mississippi river and yet it's only
RichardPreston_2008_80 of the crown structure of a redwood named iluvatar made by steve sillett marie antoine and their colleagues gives you an idea what you're seeing here is a hierarchical 
RichardPreston_2008_82 to give a sense of scale
RichardPreston_2008_86 and they would have people on their hands and so on and if we had redwood like biology we would have six layers of people on our hands as it were and it would be a lovely thing to 
RichardPreston_2008_87 be able to wave to someone and have all our reiterations wave at the same time
RichardPreston_2008_93 redwoods grow back into themselves as they expand into space and this flying buttress is a limb shot out of that small trunk going back into the main trunk and fusing with it
RichardPreston_2008_95 wired them like patients in 
RichardPreston_2008_97 in the tree itself if a portion of a redwood is rotting the redwood will send roots into its own form and draw nutrients out of itself as it falls apart
RichardPreston_2008_101 a copepod is a crustacean these copepods are a major constituent
RichardPreston_2008_104 there are some interesting theories that if i had time i would tell you about but as you go and you look closer at a tree what you see is you see increasing complexity
RichardPreston_2008_108 probably took seven hundred years to form in its complexity that we see right now as you look at a tree
RichardPreston_2008_112 a small organism appeared in richmond virginia 
RichardPreston_2008_113 called the hemlock woolly adelgid it made a trans species jump out of some other organism in asia where it was living on hemlock trees in asia when it moved into 
RichardPreston_2008_115 ways the last fragments of primeval rainforest east of the mississippi river i hadn't even known that there were rainforests in the east but in great smoky
RichardPreston_2008_116 mountains national park
RichardPreston_2008_117 it can rain up to one hundred inches of rain a year
RichardPreston_2008_120 and has absolutely wiped it out
RichardPreston_2008_122 and what we're seeing is not just the potential death of the eastern hemlock species that is to say its extinction from nature due to this invading parasite but we're also seeing the death
RichardPreston_2008_123 for which these trees are merely the substrate for the aerial
RichardPreston_2008_124 labyrinth of the sky that exists in their crowns it's absolutely heartbreaking to see one of the things that is just
RichardPreston_2008_127 transitory quality of human time
RichardPreston_2008_132 and at least for me personally the trees have taught me an entirely new way of loving my children 
RichardPreston_2008_133 exploring with them the forest canopy has been one of the most lovely things of my existence on earth
RichardPreston_2008_136 are lucky enough or possibly stupid enough to still climb trees thank you very much
RichardPreston_2008_140 spotted an unknown species of golden brown ant about halfway up the trunk 
RichardPreston_2008_141 ants are not known to occur in redwood trees curiously enough 
RichardPreston_2008_142 and we wondered whether this ant this species of ant was only endemic to that one tree
RichardPreston_2008_144 so you have to wonder when you know if some other
RichardPreston_2008_145 species than us was recording the stories that mattered on earth you know
RichardPreston_2008_149 parasites that move into the human species but that's just a very small facet of a much greater problem of invasions of species
RichardPreston_2008_150 worldwide all through the ecosystems and you know the earth itself ca partly caused by us inadvertently rp caused by humans caused by the movement of humans
RichardPreston_2008_154 richard preston thank you very much i think
