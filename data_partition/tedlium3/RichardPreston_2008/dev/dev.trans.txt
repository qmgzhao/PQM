RichardPreston_2008_3 nobody knows how old the oldest living coast redwoods are because nobody has ever drilled into any
RichardPreston_2008_4 them to count their annual growth rings and in any case the centers of the oldest individuals appear to be hollow but it's believed that the oldest living redwoods are 
RichardPreston_2008_16 here i have a tape measure
RichardPreston_2008_19 're going to show you what the diameter at breast height of a big redwood is unfortunately
RichardPreston_2008_20 this tape isn't long enough it's only
RichardPreston_2008_28 to us when we look at a redwood tree it seems to be motionless and still and yet redwoods are constantly in motion
RichardPreston_2008_29 moving upward into space 
RichardPreston_2008_39 he leaped through space and grabbed a branch with his hands and ended up hanging like catching a bar of a trapeze and then from there he climbed directly up the bark
RichardPreston_2008_53 that
RichardPreston_2008_59 tree to tree through space rather like spiderman 
RichardPreston_2008_62 of the way up that tree 
RichardPreston_2008_63 you do feel a sense of exposure there is a small person right down there on the ground you feel like you're climbing a wall of wood but then you enter the redwood canopy and 
RichardPreston_2008_68 you feel like you can't fall in fact it's difficult to move you're worming your way through branches which are crowded with living things that don't occur near the ground it's like scuba diving into a coral reef
RichardPreston_2008_70 they also have a feature thickets of huckleberry bushes that grow out of the tops of redwood trees that are technically known as huckleberry
RichardPreston_2008_71 and you can sit there and snack on the berries while you're resting
RichardPreston_2008_75 now here we see a reiteration in
RichardPreston_2008_81 schematic development of the trunks of this tree as it has elaborated itself over time into six layers of fractal of trunks springing from trunks springing from trunks 
RichardPreston_2008_83 there's the person right there the person is waving to us i've wanted to ask craig venter
RichardPreston_2008_85 who looked like us 
RichardPreston_2008_91 these are millennial structures portions of the tree that are believed to be more than one thousand years old there are four humans in this shot one two
RichardPreston_2008_92 and there's also something that i want to show you this is a flying buttress
RichardPreston_2008_103 is completely unknown
RichardPreston_2008_105 're looking at the very top of gaya
RichardPreston_2008_118 and in the last two to three summers
RichardPreston_2008_119 these invasive organisms this kind of ebola of the trees as it were has swept through the primeval hemlock forest of
RichardPreston_2008_126 what can the redwoods tell us about ourselves well i think they can tell us something about human time the flickering
RichardPreston_2008_137 it was nathan myhrvold who told me that it was thought that because these trees are like two thousand years and older on many of them there are ecosystems where there are species that are not found anywhere on the earth except on that one
RichardPreston_2008_143 possibly to that grove and in subsequent climbs they could never find that ant again and so no specimens have ever been collected we don't know what it is we just know it's there ca
RichardPreston_2008_146 our stories are about iraq and war and politics and celebrity gossip you've just told us a different story of this this tragic arms race that's happening and maybe whole
RichardPreston_2008_151 you can think of the earth's biosphere as a palace and the continents are rooms in the palace and the islands are small rooms
RichardPreston_2008_153 the doors of the palace have been flung open and the walls are coming down ca
