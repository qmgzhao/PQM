JannaLevin_2011_0 you all to consider for a second the very simple fact that by far most of what we know about the universe comes to us from light 
JannaLevin_2011_1 we can stand on the earth and look up at the night sky and see stars with our bare eyes the sun
JannaLevin_2011_2 burns our peripheral vision we see light reflected off the moon
JannaLevin_2011_3 and in the time since galileo pointed that rudimentary telescope at the celestial bodies the known universe has come to us through light across vast eras in cosmic history 
JannaLevin_2011_4 and with all of our modern telescopes
JannaLevin_2011_5 've been able to collect this stunning silent movie of the universe these series of snapshots that go all the way back to the big bang 
JannaLevin_2011_6 and yet the universe is not a silent movie because the universe isn't silent i'd like to convince you that the universe has a soundtrack and that soundtrack 
JannaLevin_2011_7 is played on space itself because space can wobble like a drum it can ring out a kind of
JannaLevin_2011_8 recording throughout the universe of some of the most dramatic events as they unfold
JannaLevin_2011_9 now we'd like to be able to add to a kind of glorious visual composition that we have of the universe a sonic composition
JannaLevin_2011_10 and
JannaLevin_2011_11 while we've never heard the sounds from space we really should
JannaLevin_2011_12 in the next few years start to turn up the volume on what's going on out there so in this ambition to capture songs from the universe we turn our 
JannaLevin_2011_13 focus to black holes and the promise they have because black holes can bang on space time like mallets on a drum and have a very characteristic song which i'd like to play for you some of our predictions for what that song will be
JannaLevin_2011_14 now black holes are dark against a dark sky we can't see them directly they're not brought to us with light at least not directly we can see them indirectly because black 
JannaLevin_2011_15 holes wreak havoc on their environment they destroy stars around them they churn up debris in their surroundings but they won't come to us directly through light we might one day see a shadow a black hole can cast on a very
JannaLevin_2011_16 and yet black holes may be heard even if they're not seen
JannaLevin_2011_17 and that's because they bang on space time like a drum 
JannaLevin_2011_18 now we owe the idea that space can ring like a drum to albert einstein to whom we owe so much einstein realized that if space were empty if the universe were 
JannaLevin_2011_19 empty it would be like this picture except for maybe without the helpful grid drawn on it but if we were freely falling through the space even without
JannaLevin_2011_20 this helpful grid we might be able to paint it ourselves because we would notice that we traveled along straight lines undeflected straight paths through the universe 
JannaLevin_2011_21 einstein also realized and this is the real meat of the matter that if you put energy or mass in the universe it would curve space and a freely
JannaLevin_2011_22 freely falling object would pass by let's say the sun and it would be deflected along the natural curves in the space it was einstein's great general theory of relativity 
JannaLevin_2011_23 now even light will be bent by those paths and you can be bent so much that you're caught in orbit around the sun as the earth is or the moon around the earth these are the natural curves in space 
JannaLevin_2011_24 what einstein did not realize was that if you took our sun and you crushed it down to
JannaLevin_2011_25 kilometers so you took a million times the mass of the earth and you crushed it to six kilometers across you would make a black hole an object so dense 
JannaLevin_2011_26 that if light veered too close it would never escape a dark shadow against the universe it wasn't einstein who realized this it was karl schwarzschild who was a german jew in world war i joined the german army already an accomplished scientist
JannaLevin_2011_27 working on the russian front i like to imagine schwarzschild in the war in the trenches calculating ballistic trajectories for cannon fire 
JannaLevin_2011_28 and then in between calculating einstein's equations as you do in the trenches and he was reading einstein's recently published general theory of relativity
JannaLevin_2011_29 and he was thrilled by this theory and he quickly surmised an exact mathematical solution that described something very extraordinary curves so strong that space 
JannaLevin_2011_30 would rain down into them space itself would curve like a waterfall flowing down the throat of a hole and even light could not escape this current light would be 
JannaLevin_2011_31 dragged down the hole as everything else would be and all that would be left would be a shadow
JannaLevin_2011_32 you will see the war has been kind to me enough despite the heavy gunfire
JannaLevin_2011_33 i've been able to get away from it all and walk through the land of your ideas and einstein was very impressed with his exact solution and i should hope also the dedication of the scientist
JannaLevin_2011_34 this is the hardworking scientist under harsh conditions and he took schwarzschild's idea to the prussian academy of sciences the next week
JannaLevin_2011_35 but einstein always thought black holes were a mathematical oddity he did not believe they existed in nature he thought nature would protect us from their formation it was decades 
JannaLevin_2011_36 before the term black hole was coined and people realized that black holes are real astrophysical objects in fact they're the death state of very massive stars that collapse catastrophically at the end of their lifetime
JannaLevin_2011_37 now our sun will not collapse to a black hole it's actually not massive enough
JannaLevin_2011_38 but if we did a little thought experiment as einstein was very fond of doing we could imagine putting the sun crushed down to six kilometers and putting a tiny 
JannaLevin_2011_39 little earth around it in orbit maybe thirty kilometers outside of of the
JannaLevin_2011_40 because now the sun's gone we have no other source of light so let's make our little earth self illuminated
JannaLevin_2011_41 and you would realize you could put the earth in a happy orbit even thirty km outside of this
JannaLevin_2011_42 crushed black hole this crushed black hole actually would fit inside manhattan more or less it might spill off into the hudson a little bit before it destroyed the earth but basically 
JannaLevin_2011_43 that's what we're talking about we're talking about an object that you could crush down to half the square area of manhattan so we
JannaLevin_2011_44 move this earth very close thirty kilometers outside and we notice it's perfectly fine orbiting around the black hole there's a sort of myth that black holes devour everything in the universe but you actually have to get very close to fall in
JannaLevin_2011_45 but what's very impressive is that from our vantage point we can always see the earth it cannot hide behind the black
JannaLevin_2011_46 the light from the earth some of it falls in but some of it gets lensed around and brought back to us so you can't hide anything behind a black hole if this were battlestar galactica and you're fighting the cylons don't hide behind the black hole
JannaLevin_2011_47 they can see you 
JannaLevin_2011_48 now our sun will not collapse to a black hole it's not massive enough but there are tens of thousands of black holes in our galaxy
JannaLevin_2011_49 and if one were to eclipse the milky way this is what it would look like we would see
JannaLevin_2011_50 shadow of that black hole against the hundred billion stars in the milky way galaxy and its luminous dust lanes and if we were to fall towards this black hole 
JannaLevin_2011_51 we would see all of that light lensed around it and we could even start to cross into that shadow and really not notice that anything dramatic had happened 
JannaLevin_2011_52 light can escape but even though the black hole is dark from the outside it's not dark on the inside because all of the light from the galaxy can fall in behind us and even 
JannaLevin_2011_53 though due to a relativistic effect known as time dilation our clocks would seem to slow down relative to galactic time it would look as though the evolution of the galaxy had been sped up and shot at us right before
JannaLevin_2011_54 we were crushed to death by the black hole it would be like a near death experience where you see the light at the end of the tunnel but it's a total death experience
JannaLevin_2011_55 and there's no way of telling anybody about the light at the end of the tunnel 
JannaLevin_2011_56 now we've never seen a shadow like this of a black hole but black holes can be heard even if
JannaLevin_2011_57 they're not seen
JannaLevin_2011_58 imagine now taking an astrophysically realistic situation imagine two black holes that have lived a long life together maybe they started as stars and collapsed to two 
JannaLevin_2011_59 black holes each one ten times the mass of the sun so now we're going to crush them down to sixty kilometers across they can be spinning hundreds of times a 
JannaLevin_2011_60 second at the end of their lives they're going around each other very near the speed of light so they're crossing thousands of kilometers in a fraction
JannaLevin_2011_61 of a second and as they do so they not only curve space but they leave behind in their wake a ringing of space an actual wave on space time space squeezes 
JannaLevin_2011_62 and stretches as it emanates out from these black holes banging on the universe and they travel out
JannaLevin_2011_63 thirty years for anyone in the world to crack this problem this was one of the groups it shows two black holes in orbit around each other again with these helpfully painted curves and if you can see 
JannaLevin_2011_64 it's kind of faint but if you can see the red waves emanating out those are the gravitational waves they're literally the sounds of space ringing and they will travel out from these black holes at the speed of light as they ring down and coalesce to one
JannaLevin_2011_65 spinning quiet black hole at the end of the day
JannaLevin_2011_66 if you were standing near enough your ear would resonate with the squeezing and stretching of space you would literally hear the sound now of course your head would be squeezed and stretched unhelpfully so you might have trouble understanding what's going on
JannaLevin_2011_67 but
JannaLevin_2011_68 i'd like to play for you the sound that we predict this is from my group a slightly less
JannaLevin_2011_69 glamorous
JannaLevin_2011_70 computer modeling imagine a lighter black hole falling into a very heavy black hole the sound you're hearing is the light black hole banging
JannaLevin_2011_71 on space each time it gets close if it gets far away it's a little too quiet 
JannaLevin_2011_72 wobbling it like a drum and we can predict what the sound will be we know that as it falls in it gets faster and it gets louder and eventually we're going to hear the little guy just fall into the bigger guy
JannaLevin_2011_73 it's gone now i've never heard it that loud it's actually more dramatic at home it sounds kind of anticlimactic it's sort of like ding ding ding this is
JannaLevin_2011_74 another sound from my group no i'm not showing you any images because black holes don't leave behind helpful trails of ink and space is not painted showing you the curves
JannaLevin_2011_75 but if you were to
JannaLevin_2011_76 float by
JannaLevin_2011_77 in space on a space holiday and you heard this you want to get moving
JannaLevin_2011_78 want to get away from the sound 
JannaLevin_2011_79 both black holes are moving both black holes are getting closer together in this case they're both wobbling quite a lot 
JannaLevin_2011_80 and then they're going to merge
JannaLevin_2011_81 now that chirp is very characteristic of black holes merging that it chirps up at the end now
JannaLevin_2011_82 that's our prediction for what we'll see luckily we're at this safe distance in long beach california and surely somewhere in the universe two black holes have merged and surely
JannaLevin_2011_83 the space around us is ringing after traveling maybe a million light years or a million years at the speed of light to get to us but the sound is too 
JannaLevin_2011_84 quiet for any of us to ever hear there are very industrious experiments being built on earth one called ligo which will detect deviations in the squeezing and stretching of space at less than the fraction of a nucleus of an
JannaLevin_2011_85 over four kilometers it's a remarkably ambitious experiment and it's going to be at advanced sensitivity within the next few years to pick this up there's also a mission proposed 
JannaLevin_2011_86 for space which hopefully will launch in the next ten years called lisa and lisa will be able to see 
JannaLevin_2011_87 black holes black holes millions or billions of times the mass of the sun in this hubble image we see two
JannaLevin_2011_88 they look like they're frozen in some embrace and each one probably harbors a super massive black hole at its core 
JannaLevin_2011_89 but they're not frozen they're actually merging these two black holes are colliding and they will merge over a billion year time scale it's beyond our 
JannaLevin_2011_90 human perception to pick up a song of that duration but lisa could see the final
JannaLevin_2011_91 black holes earlier in the universe's history the last fifteen minutes before they fall together 
JannaLevin_2011_92 and it's not just black holes but it's also any big disturbance in the universe and the biggest of them all is the big bang when that expression was coined it was derisive 
JannaLevin_2011_93 like oh who would believe in a big bang but now it actually might be more technically accurate because it might bang
JannaLevin_2011_94 we don't ever want to do that actually we want to be inside the universe because there's no such thing as standing outside the universe so imagine you're inside the big bang it's everywhere it's all around you and the space 
JannaLevin_2011_95 is wobbling chaotically fourteen billion years pass and this song is still ringing all around us galaxies form and generations of stars form in those galaxies and around one star at least one star
JannaLevin_2011_96 is a habitable planet and here we are frantically building these experiments doing these calculations writing these computer codes imagine a billion years ago two 
JannaLevin_2011_97 black holes collided that song has been ringing through space for all that time we weren't even here it gets closer and closer forty thousand
JannaLevin_2011_98 're still doing cave paintings it's like hurry build your instruments it's getting closer and closer and in twenty whatever year it will be when our detectors are finally at advanced sensitivity we'll build them we'll turn on the machines and bang we'll catch it
JannaLevin_2011_99 the first song from space if it was the big bang we were going to pick up it would sound like this
JannaLevin_2011_100 it's a terrible sound it's literally the definition of noise it's white noise it's such a chaotic ringing but it's around us
JannaLevin_2011_101 everywhere
JannaLevin_2011_102 presumably if it hasn't been wiped out by some other process in the universe and if we pick it up it will be music to our ears because it will be the quiet echo of that moment of our creation of our observable universe
JannaLevin_2011_103 so within the next few years we'll be able to turn up the soundtrack a little bit render
JannaLevin_2011_104 the universe in audio but if we detect those earliest moments it
JannaLevin_2011_105 bring us that much closer to an understanding of the big bang which brings us that much closer to asking some of the hardest most elusive questions if we 
JannaLevin_2011_106 run the movie of our universe backwards we know that there was a big bang in our past 
JannaLevin_2011_107 happen again i mean in the spirit of rising to ted's challenge to reignite wonder we can ask questions at least for this last minute that honestly 
JannaLevin_2011_108 might evade us forever but we have to ask is it possible that our universe is just a plume off of some greater history or is it possible that we're just a branch off of a multiverse each branch with its own big bang
JannaLevin_2011_109 in its past maybe some of them with black holes playing drums maybe some without maybe some with sentient life and maybe some without not in our past not in our future but somehow fundamentally connected to us
JannaLevin_2011_110 so we have to wonder if there is a multiverse in some other patch of that multiverse are there creatures here's my
JannaLevin_2011_111 are there other creatures in the multiverse wondering about us and wondering about their own origins and if they are
JannaLevin_2011_112 i can imagine them
JannaLevin_2011_113 as we are calculating writing computer code building instruments trying to detect that faintest sound
JannaLevin_2011_114 of their origins and wondering who else is out there thank you
