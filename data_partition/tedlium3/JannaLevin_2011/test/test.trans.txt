JannaLevin_2011_3 and in the time since galileo pointed that rudimentary telescope at the celestial bodies the known universe has come to us through light across vast eras in cosmic history 
JannaLevin_2011_9 now we'd like to be able to add to a kind of glorious visual composition that we have of the universe a sonic composition
JannaLevin_2011_12 in the next few years start to turn up the volume on what's going on out there so in this ambition to capture songs from the universe we turn our 
JannaLevin_2011_16 and yet black holes may be heard even if they're not seen
JannaLevin_2011_18 now we owe the idea that space can ring like a drum to albert einstein to whom we owe so much einstein realized that if space were empty if the universe were 
JannaLevin_2011_26 that if light veered too close it would never escape a dark shadow against the universe it wasn't einstein who realized this it was karl schwarzschild who was a german jew in world war i joined the german army already an accomplished scientist
JannaLevin_2011_33 i've been able to get away from it all and walk through the land of your ideas and einstein was very impressed with his exact solution and i should hope also the dedication of the scientist
JannaLevin_2011_36 before the term black hole was coined and people realized that black holes are real astrophysical objects in fact they're the death state of very massive stars that collapse catastrophically at the end of their lifetime
JannaLevin_2011_39 little earth around it in orbit maybe thirty kilometers outside of of the
JannaLevin_2011_40 because now the sun's gone we have no other source of light so let's make our little earth self illuminated
JannaLevin_2011_41 and you would realize you could put the earth in a happy orbit even thirty km outside of this
JannaLevin_2011_42 crushed black hole this crushed black hole actually would fit inside manhattan more or less it might spill off into the hudson a little bit before it destroyed the earth but basically 
JannaLevin_2011_45 but what's very impressive is that from our vantage point we can always see the earth it cannot hide behind the black
JannaLevin_2011_48 now our sun will not collapse to a black hole it's not massive enough but there are tens of thousands of black holes in our galaxy
JannaLevin_2011_50 shadow of that black hole against the hundred billion stars in the milky way galaxy and its luminous dust lanes and if we were to fall towards this black hole 
JannaLevin_2011_52 light can escape but even though the black hole is dark from the outside it's not dark on the inside because all of the light from the galaxy can fall in behind us and even 
JannaLevin_2011_53 though due to a relativistic effect known as time dilation our clocks would seem to slow down relative to galactic time it would look as though the evolution of the galaxy had been sped up and shot at us right before
JannaLevin_2011_54 we were crushed to death by the black hole it would be like a near death experience where you see the light at the end of the tunnel but it's a total death experience
JannaLevin_2011_56 now we've never seen a shadow like this of a black hole but black holes can be heard even if
JannaLevin_2011_59 black holes each one ten times the mass of the sun so now we're going to crush them down to sixty kilometers across they can be spinning hundreds of times a 
JannaLevin_2011_67 but
JannaLevin_2011_71 on space each time it gets close if it gets far away it's a little too quiet 
JannaLevin_2011_74 another sound from my group no i'm not showing you any images because black holes don't leave behind helpful trails of ink and space is not painted showing you the curves
JannaLevin_2011_76 float by
JannaLevin_2011_77 in space on a space holiday and you heard this you want to get moving
JannaLevin_2011_78 want to get away from the sound 
JannaLevin_2011_79 both black holes are moving both black holes are getting closer together in this case they're both wobbling quite a lot 
JannaLevin_2011_81 now that chirp is very characteristic of black holes merging that it chirps up at the end now
JannaLevin_2011_84 quiet for any of us to ever hear there are very industrious experiments being built on earth one called ligo which will detect deviations in the squeezing and stretching of space at less than the fraction of a nucleus of an
JannaLevin_2011_85 over four kilometers it's a remarkably ambitious experiment and it's going to be at advanced sensitivity within the next few years to pick this up there's also a mission proposed 
JannaLevin_2011_86 for space which hopefully will launch in the next ten years called lisa and lisa will be able to see 
JannaLevin_2011_91 black holes earlier in the universe's history the last fifteen minutes before they fall together 
JannaLevin_2011_92 and it's not just black holes but it's also any big disturbance in the universe and the biggest of them all is the big bang when that expression was coined it was derisive 
JannaLevin_2011_94 we don't ever want to do that actually we want to be inside the universe because there's no such thing as standing outside the universe so imagine you're inside the big bang it's everywhere it's all around you and the space 
JannaLevin_2011_95 is wobbling chaotically fourteen billion years pass and this song is still ringing all around us galaxies form and generations of stars form in those galaxies and around one star at least one star
JannaLevin_2011_96 is a habitable planet and here we are frantically building these experiments doing these calculations writing these computer codes imagine a billion years ago two 
JannaLevin_2011_97 black holes collided that song has been ringing through space for all that time we weren't even here it gets closer and closer forty thousand
JannaLevin_2011_99 the first song from space if it was the big bang we were going to pick up it would sound like this
JannaLevin_2011_103 so within the next few years we'll be able to turn up the soundtrack a little bit render
JannaLevin_2011_104 the universe in audio but if we detect those earliest moments it
JannaLevin_2011_105 bring us that much closer to an understanding of the big bang which brings us that much closer to asking some of the hardest most elusive questions if we 
JannaLevin_2011_107 happen again i mean in the spirit of rising to ted's challenge to reignite wonder we can ask questions at least for this last minute that honestly 
JannaLevin_2011_110 so we have to wonder if there is a multiverse in some other patch of that multiverse are there creatures here's my
JannaLevin_2011_111 are there other creatures in the multiverse wondering about us and wondering about their own origins and if they are
JannaLevin_2011_112 i can imagine them
JannaLevin_2011_113 as we are calculating writing computer code building instruments trying to detect that faintest sound
