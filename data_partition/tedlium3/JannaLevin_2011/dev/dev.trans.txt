JannaLevin_2011_2 burns our peripheral vision we see light reflected off the moon
JannaLevin_2011_13 focus to black holes and the promise they have because black holes can bang on space time like mallets on a drum and have a very characteristic song which i'd like to play for you some of our predictions for what that song will be
JannaLevin_2011_15 holes wreak havoc on their environment they destroy stars around them they churn up debris in their surroundings but they won't come to us directly through light we might one day see a shadow a black hole can cast on a very
JannaLevin_2011_19 empty it would be like this picture except for maybe without the helpful grid drawn on it but if we were freely falling through the space even without
JannaLevin_2011_22 freely falling object would pass by let's say the sun and it would be deflected along the natural curves in the space it was einstein's great general theory of relativity 
JannaLevin_2011_24 what einstein did not realize was that if you took our sun and you crushed it down to
JannaLevin_2011_29 and he was thrilled by this theory and he quickly surmised an exact mathematical solution that described something very extraordinary curves so strong that space 
JannaLevin_2011_32 you will see the war has been kind to me enough despite the heavy gunfire
JannaLevin_2011_35 but einstein always thought black holes were a mathematical oddity he did not believe they existed in nature he thought nature would protect us from their formation it was decades 
JannaLevin_2011_37 now our sun will not collapse to a black hole it's actually not massive enough
JannaLevin_2011_38 but if we did a little thought experiment as einstein was very fond of doing we could imagine putting the sun crushed down to six kilometers and putting a tiny 
JannaLevin_2011_46 the light from the earth some of it falls in but some of it gets lensed around and brought back to us so you can't hide anything behind a black hole if this were battlestar galactica and you're fighting the cylons don't hide behind the black hole
JannaLevin_2011_51 we would see all of that light lensed around it and we could even start to cross into that shadow and really not notice that anything dramatic had happened 
JannaLevin_2011_57 they're not seen
JannaLevin_2011_61 of a second and as they do so they not only curve space but they leave behind in their wake a ringing of space an actual wave on space time space squeezes 
JannaLevin_2011_63 thirty years for anyone in the world to crack this problem this was one of the groups it shows two black holes in orbit around each other again with these helpfully painted curves and if you can see 
JannaLevin_2011_66 if you were standing near enough your ear would resonate with the squeezing and stretching of space you would literally hear the sound now of course your head would be squeezed and stretched unhelpfully so you might have trouble understanding what's going on
JannaLevin_2011_69 glamorous
JannaLevin_2011_70 computer modeling imagine a lighter black hole falling into a very heavy black hole the sound you're hearing is the light black hole banging
JannaLevin_2011_73 it's gone now i've never heard it that loud it's actually more dramatic at home it sounds kind of anticlimactic it's sort of like ding ding ding this is
JannaLevin_2011_83 the space around us is ringing after traveling maybe a million light years or a million years at the speed of light to get to us but the sound is too 
JannaLevin_2011_88 they look like they're frozen in some embrace and each one probably harbors a super massive black hole at its core 
JannaLevin_2011_90 human perception to pick up a song of that duration but lisa could see the final
