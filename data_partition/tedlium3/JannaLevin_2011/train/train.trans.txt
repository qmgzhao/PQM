JannaLevin_2011_0 you all to consider for a second the very simple fact that by far most of what we know about the universe comes to us from light 
JannaLevin_2011_1 we can stand on the earth and look up at the night sky and see stars with our bare eyes the sun
JannaLevin_2011_4 and with all of our modern telescopes
JannaLevin_2011_5 've been able to collect this stunning silent movie of the universe these series of snapshots that go all the way back to the big bang 
JannaLevin_2011_6 and yet the universe is not a silent movie because the universe isn't silent i'd like to convince you that the universe has a soundtrack and that soundtrack 
JannaLevin_2011_7 is played on space itself because space can wobble like a drum it can ring out a kind of
JannaLevin_2011_8 recording throughout the universe of some of the most dramatic events as they unfold
JannaLevin_2011_10 and
JannaLevin_2011_11 while we've never heard the sounds from space we really should
JannaLevin_2011_14 now black holes are dark against a dark sky we can't see them directly they're not brought to us with light at least not directly we can see them indirectly because black 
JannaLevin_2011_17 and that's because they bang on space time like a drum 
JannaLevin_2011_20 this helpful grid we might be able to paint it ourselves because we would notice that we traveled along straight lines undeflected straight paths through the universe 
JannaLevin_2011_21 einstein also realized and this is the real meat of the matter that if you put energy or mass in the universe it would curve space and a freely
JannaLevin_2011_23 now even light will be bent by those paths and you can be bent so much that you're caught in orbit around the sun as the earth is or the moon around the earth these are the natural curves in space 
JannaLevin_2011_25 kilometers so you took a million times the mass of the earth and you crushed it to six kilometers across you would make a black hole an object so dense 
JannaLevin_2011_27 working on the russian front i like to imagine schwarzschild in the war in the trenches calculating ballistic trajectories for cannon fire 
JannaLevin_2011_28 and then in between calculating einstein's equations as you do in the trenches and he was reading einstein's recently published general theory of relativity
JannaLevin_2011_30 would rain down into them space itself would curve like a waterfall flowing down the throat of a hole and even light could not escape this current light would be 
JannaLevin_2011_31 dragged down the hole as everything else would be and all that would be left would be a shadow
JannaLevin_2011_34 this is the hardworking scientist under harsh conditions and he took schwarzschild's idea to the prussian academy of sciences the next week
JannaLevin_2011_43 that's what we're talking about we're talking about an object that you could crush down to half the square area of manhattan so we
JannaLevin_2011_44 move this earth very close thirty kilometers outside and we notice it's perfectly fine orbiting around the black hole there's a sort of myth that black holes devour everything in the universe but you actually have to get very close to fall in
JannaLevin_2011_47 they can see you 
JannaLevin_2011_49 and if one were to eclipse the milky way this is what it would look like we would see
JannaLevin_2011_55 and there's no way of telling anybody about the light at the end of the tunnel 
JannaLevin_2011_58 imagine now taking an astrophysically realistic situation imagine two black holes that have lived a long life together maybe they started as stars and collapsed to two 
JannaLevin_2011_60 second at the end of their lives they're going around each other very near the speed of light so they're crossing thousands of kilometers in a fraction
JannaLevin_2011_62 and stretches as it emanates out from these black holes banging on the universe and they travel out
JannaLevin_2011_64 it's kind of faint but if you can see the red waves emanating out those are the gravitational waves they're literally the sounds of space ringing and they will travel out from these black holes at the speed of light as they ring down and coalesce to one
JannaLevin_2011_65 spinning quiet black hole at the end of the day
JannaLevin_2011_68 i'd like to play for you the sound that we predict this is from my group a slightly less
JannaLevin_2011_72 wobbling it like a drum and we can predict what the sound will be we know that as it falls in it gets faster and it gets louder and eventually we're going to hear the little guy just fall into the bigger guy
JannaLevin_2011_75 but if you were to
JannaLevin_2011_80 and then they're going to merge
JannaLevin_2011_82 that's our prediction for what we'll see luckily we're at this safe distance in long beach california and surely somewhere in the universe two black holes have merged and surely
JannaLevin_2011_87 black holes black holes millions or billions of times the mass of the sun in this hubble image we see two
JannaLevin_2011_89 but they're not frozen they're actually merging these two black holes are colliding and they will merge over a billion year time scale it's beyond our 
JannaLevin_2011_93 like oh who would believe in a big bang but now it actually might be more technically accurate because it might bang
JannaLevin_2011_98 're still doing cave paintings it's like hurry build your instruments it's getting closer and closer and in twenty whatever year it will be when our detectors are finally at advanced sensitivity we'll build them we'll turn on the machines and bang we'll catch it
JannaLevin_2011_100 it's a terrible sound it's literally the definition of noise it's white noise it's such a chaotic ringing but it's around us
JannaLevin_2011_101 everywhere
JannaLevin_2011_102 presumably if it hasn't been wiped out by some other process in the universe and if we pick it up it will be music to our ears because it will be the quiet echo of that moment of our creation of our observable universe
JannaLevin_2011_106 run the movie of our universe backwards we know that there was a big bang in our past 
JannaLevin_2011_108 might evade us forever but we have to ask is it possible that our universe is just a plume off of some greater history or is it possible that we're just a branch off of a multiverse each branch with its own big bang
JannaLevin_2011_109 in its past maybe some of them with black holes playing drums maybe some without maybe some with sentient life and maybe some without not in our past not in our future but somehow fundamentally connected to us
JannaLevin_2011_114 of their origins and wondering who else is out there thank you
