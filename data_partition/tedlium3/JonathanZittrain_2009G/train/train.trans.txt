JonathanZittrain_2009G_0 my name is jonathan zittrain and in my recent work i've been a bit of a pessimist so i thought this morning i would try to be the optimist and give reason to hope for the future of the internet by drawing upon its present
JonathanZittrain_2009G_7 but i want to give you three examples to try to say that the trend line is in fact in the other direction and it's the internet helping it along 
JonathanZittrain_2009G_12 they had one great limitation and one great freedom as they tried to conceive of a global network
JonathanZittrain_2009G_15 but they had an amazing freedom which was they didn't have to make any money from it
JonathanZittrain_2009G_17 no firm responsible singly for building it 
JonathanZittrain_2009G_20 was known to say you couldn't possibly build a corporate network using internet protocol
JonathanZittrain_2009G_22 that's why the mascot of internet engineering if it had one is said to be the bumblebee because the
JonathanZittrain_2009G_24 i'm pleased to say that thanks to massive government funding about three years ago we finally figured out how bees fly it
JonathanZittrain_2009G_29 and it gets handed at the aisle and
JonathanZittrain_2009G_31 to get it to the destination 
JonathanZittrain_2009G_37 the internet needs addressing and directions it turns out there is no one overall map of the internet
JonathanZittrain_2009G_38 instead again it is as if we are all sitting together in a theater but we can only see amidst the fog the people immediately around us 
JonathanZittrain_2009G_39 so what do we do to figure out who is where
JonathanZittrain_2009G_42 this is a system that relies on kindness and trust
JonathanZittrain_2009G_46 last year the government of pakistan asked its internet service providers there to prevent
JonathanZittrain_2009G_48 well this one isp in pakistan chose to effectuate the block for its subscribers in a rather unusual way
JonathanZittrain_2009G_50 that's right it said i am youtube which meant that packets of data from
JonathanZittrain_2009G_54 at moment number two you have the fake announcement go out and within two minutes
JonathanZittrain_2009G_55 it reverberates around and youtube is blocked everywhere in the world if you were sitting in oxford england trying to get to youtube your packets were going to pakistan and they weren't coming back
JonathanZittrain_2009G_59 how did this happen 
JonathanZittrain_2009G_64 fixed proportion font like this
JonathanZittrain_2009G_69 the bad news is there is no fire brigade
JonathanZittrain_2009G_71 i was trying to think of the right model to describe
JonathanZittrain_2009G_72 this form of random acts of kindness by geeky strangers
JonathanZittrain_2009G_73 you know it's just like the hail goes out and people are ready to help 
JonathanZittrain_2009G_74 and it turns out this model is everywhere once you start looking for it 
JonathanZittrain_2009G_76 man named jimbo came up to you in two thousand and one and said i've got a great idea we start with seven articles that anybody can edit anything at any time and we'll get a great encyclopedia eh
JonathanZittrain_2009G_77 right dumbest idea ever
JonathanZittrain_2009G_79 that even jimbo never had it jimbo's idea was for nupedia it was going to be totally traditional he would pay people money because he was
JonathanZittrain_2009G_80 feeling like a good guy
JonathanZittrain_2009G_81 and the money would go to the people and they would write the articles 
JonathanZittrain_2009G_84 i am not making this up
JonathanZittrain_2009G_85 i have a theory i can explain later suffice it to say for now that i prefer my wikipedia stir fried with pimentos
JonathanZittrain_2009G_86 laughter but now wikipedia doesn't just spontaneously work how does it really work it turns out there is a back room that is kind of windowless
JonathanZittrain_2009G_89 and you just bring your problems to the page it's reminiscent of the description of history as one damn thing after another
JonathanZittrain_2009G_90 right number one tendentious editing by user andyvphil

JonathanZittrain_2009G_102 is something that the crazed late traffic engineer hans monderman discovered in the netherlands and here in south kensington that sometimes if you remove some 
JonathanZittrain_2009G_104 which people can function
JonathanZittrain_2009G_109 every article on wikipedia has a corresponding discussion page and on the discussion page they had extensive argument among the wikipedians as to whether to have his real name featured in the article
JonathanZittrain_2009G_111 they eventually decided not unanimously by any means not to include his real name despite the fact that nearly all media reports did they just didn't think 
JonathanZittrain_2009G_112 it was the right thing to do it was an act of kindness and to this day the page for star wars kid has a warning right at the top that says you are not to put his real name on the page if you do it will
JonathanZittrain_2009G_113 removed immediately removed by people who may have disagreed with the original decision but respect the outcome and work to make it stay because they believe in something bigger than their own opinion
JonathanZittrain_2009G_114 as a lawyer i've got to say these guys are inventing the law and stare decisis and stuff like that as they go along 
JonathanZittrain_2009G_115 now this isn't just limited to wikipedia we see it on blogs

JonathanZittrain_2009G_151 successful couch surfings there have been and if you're wondering no there have been no known fatalities associated with couchsurfing although to be sure the reputation system at the moment works that you leave your report after the couch surfing experience so there may be some
