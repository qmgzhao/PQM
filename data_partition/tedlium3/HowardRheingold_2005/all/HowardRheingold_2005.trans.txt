HowardRheingold_2005_0 i'm here to enlist you
HowardRheingold_2005_1 in helping reshape the story about how humans and other critters get things
HowardRheingold_2005_2 here is the old story we've already heard a little bit about it biology
HowardRheingold_2005_3 is war
HowardRheingold_2005_4 in which only the fiercest survive businesses
HowardRheingold_2005_5 and nations succeed only
HowardRheingold_2005_6 by defeating destroying and dominating
HowardRheingold_2005_7 is about your side winning
HowardRheingold_2005_8 at all costs 
HowardRheingold_2005_9 but i think we can see the very beginnings of a new story beginning to emerge
HowardRheingold_2005_10 it's a narrative spread across
HowardRheingold_2005_11 a number of different disciplines 
HowardRheingold_2005_12 survival of the fittest shrinks just a little bit to make room 
HowardRheingold_2005_13 i started thinking about the relationship between
HowardRheingold_2005_14 communication
HowardRheingold_2005_15 media and
HowardRheingold_2005_16 collective action when i wrote smart mobs and i found that when i finished the book i kept thinking about it 
HowardRheingold_2005_17 in fact if you look back
HowardRheingold_2005_18 human communication media and
HowardRheingold_2005_19 the ways in which we organize
HowardRheingold_2005_20 for quite a long time humans have lived for much much longer than the approximately ten thousand years of
HowardRheingold_2005_21 settled agricultural civilization
HowardRheingold_2005_22 in small family groups nomadic hunters bring down rabbits gathering food
HowardRheingold_2005_23 the form of wealth in those days was enough food to stay alive 
HowardRheingold_2005_24 but at some point
HowardRheingold_2005_25 they banded together to hunt bigger game and we don't know exactly how they did this although
HowardRheingold_2005_26 they must have solved some collective action problems
HowardRheingold_2005_27 it only makes sense that you can't hunt mastodons while you're fighting with the other groups 
HowardRheingold_2005_28 and again we have no way of knowing but it's clear that a new form of wealth
HowardRheingold_2005_29 wealth must have emerged more protein than a hunter's family could eat before it rotted 
HowardRheingold_2005_30 so that raised a social question that i believe must have driven new social forms
HowardRheingold_2005_31 did the people who ate that mastodon meat owe something to the hunters and their families and
HowardRheingold_2005_32 how did they make arrangements again we can't know but
HowardRheingold_2005_33 we can be pretty sure that some form of symbolic communication must have been involved of
HowardRheingold_2005_34 course with agriculture came the first big civilizations the first cities built of mud and brick the first empires and it was the administers of these empires
HowardRheingold_2005_35 who began hiring people to keep track of the wheat and sheep and wine
HowardRheingold_2005_36 that was owed and the taxes that was owed on them by making marks marks on clay in that time
HowardRheingold_2005_37 not too much longer after that the alphabet was invented
HowardRheingold_2005_38 and this powerful tool was really reserved for thousands of years for the elite
HowardRheingold_2005_39 who kept track
HowardRheingold_2005_40 of accounts for the empires and then another communication technology enabled new media the printing press came along and within decades 
HowardRheingold_2005_41 millions of people became literate 
HowardRheingold_2005_42 and from literate populations new forms of collective action emerged in in the spheres of knowledge
HowardRheingold_2005_43 and politics we saw scientific revolutions the protestant reformation constitutional democracies
HowardRheingold_2005_44 possible where they had not been possible before not created by the printing press but enabled by the collective action that emerges from literacy 
HowardRheingold_2005_45 new forms of wealth emerged 
HowardRheingold_2005_46 now commerce is ancient markets are as old as the crossroads 
HowardRheingold_2005_47 but capitalism as we know it is only a few hundred years old
HowardRheingold_2005_48 enabled by cooperative arrangements and technologies such as the joint stock ownership company shared liability insurance double entry bookkeeping 
HowardRheingold_2005_49 now of course the enabling technologies
HowardRheingold_2005_50 are based
HowardRheingold_2005_51 on the internet and in the
HowardRheingold_2005_52 era every desktop is now a printing press a broadcasting station a community
HowardRheingold_2005_53 or a marketplace 
HowardRheingold_2005_54 evolution is speeding up
HowardRheingold_2005_55 more recently that power is untethering and leaping off the desktops and very very quickly
HowardRheingold_2005_56 to see a significant proportion if not the majority of the human race walking around
HowardRheingold_2005_57 holding 
HowardRheingold_2005_58 carrying or wearing supercomputers linked at speeds greater than what we consider to be broadband today 
HowardRheingold_2005_59 now when i started looking into collective action the considerable literature on it
HowardRheingold_2005_60 is based on what sociologists call social dilemmas and there are a couple of mythic narratives of social dilemmas i'm going to
HowardRheingold_2005_61 talk briefly about two of them the prisoner's dilemma and the tragedy of the commons 
HowardRheingold_2005_62 now when i talked about this with kevin kelly he assured me that everybody in this audience
HowardRheingold_2005_63 pretty much knows the details of the prisoner's dilemma
HowardRheingold_2005_64 so i'm just going to go over that very very quickly if you have more questions about it ask kevin kelly later
HowardRheingold_2005_65 laughter the prisoner's dilemma is actually a story that's overlaid on a mathematical matrix that came out of the game theory
HowardRheingold_2005_66 in the early years of thinking about nuclear war two players who couldn't trust each other 
HowardRheingold_2005_67 let me just say that every unsecured transaction is a good example of a prisoner's dilemma person with the
HowardRheingold_2005_68 goods person with the money because they can't trust each other are not going to exchange neither one wants to be the first one
HowardRheingold_2005_69 or they're going to get the sucker's payoff but both lose of course because they don't get what they want if they could only agree if they could only turn a prisoner's dilemma into
HowardRheingold_2005_70 a different payoff matrix called an assurance game they could proceed
HowardRheingold_2005_71 twenty years ago robert axelrod used the prisoner's dilemma as a probe of the biological question
HowardRheingold_2005_72 if we are here because our ancestors were such fierce competitors how does cooperation exist at all he started a computer tournament for people to submit prisoner
HowardRheingold_2005_73 's dilemma strategies and discovered much to his surprise that a very very simple strategy won
HowardRheingold_2005_74 it won the first tournament and even after everyone knew it won
HowardRheingold_2005_75 it won the second tournament that's known as tit for tat
HowardRheingold_2005_76 another economic game that may not be as well known as the prisoner's dilemma is the ultimatum game
HowardRheingold_2005_77 and it's also a very interesting probe of our assumptions about
HowardRheingold_2005_78 the way people make economic transactions here's how the game is played
HowardRheingold_2005_79 there are two players they've never played the game before they will not play the game again they don't know each other and they are in fact in separate rooms first player is offered a hundred dollars
HowardRheingold_2005_80 and is asked to propose a split 
HowardRheingold_2005_81 that player wants to propose the second player
HowardRheingold_2005_82 either accepts the split both
HowardRheingold_2005_83 players are paid and the game is over
HowardRheingold_2005_84 or rejects the split neither player is paid and the game is over
HowardRheingold_2005_85 now the fundamental basis of neoclassical economics would tell you it's irrational to reject a dollar because someone you don't know in another room is
HowardRheingold_2005_86 going to get ninety nine yet in thousands of trials with american and european and japanese students
HowardRheingold_2005_87 a significant percentage would reject any offer that's not close to fifty fifty and although
HowardRheingold_2005_88 they were screened and didn't know about the game and had never played
HowardRheingold_2005_89 to innately know this because the average proposal was surprisingly close to fifty fifty 
HowardRheingold_2005_90 now the interesting part comes in more recently when anthropologists began taking this game to other cultures
HowardRheingold_2005_91 and discovered to their surprise that
HowardRheingold_2005_92 agriculturalists in the amazon or nomadic pastoralists in central asia or a dozen different cultures each had radically
HowardRheingold_2005_93 different ideas of what is fair which suggests that instead of there being an innate sense of fairness that somehow the basis of our economic transactions transactions
HowardRheingold_2005_94 can be influenced by
HowardRheingold_2005_95 our social institutions whether we know that or not the other major narrative of social dilemmas is the tragedy of the commons
HowardRheingold_2005_96 garrett hardin used it to talk about overpopulation in the late 1960s he used the
HowardRheingold_2005_97 example of a common grazing area in which each person
HowardRheingold_2005_98 by simply maximizing their own flock led to overgrazing and the depletion of the resource he had the rather gloomy conclusion that humans will inevitably despoil any common pool resource
HowardRheingold_2005_99 in which people cannot be restrained from using it 
HowardRheingold_2005_100 now elinor ostrom a political scientist in one thousand nine hundred and ninety ninety asked the interesting question that any good scientist should ask which is is
HowardRheingold_2005_101 it really true that humans will always despoil commons so she went out and looked at what data she could find she looked at thousands of
HowardRheingold_2005_102 of humans sharing watersheds forestry resources fisheries and discovered that yes in case after case humans
HowardRheingold_2005_103 destroyed the commons that they depended on but she also found many instances in which people escaped the prisoner's dilemma
HowardRheingold_2005_104 the tragedy of the commons is a multiplayer prisoner's dilemma and she said that people are only prisoners
HowardRheingold_2005_105 if they consider themselves to be
HowardRheingold_2005_106 they escape by creating institutions for collective action and she discovered i think most interestingly that
HowardRheingold_2005_107 among those institutions that worked there were a number of common design principles
HowardRheingold_2005_108 and those principles seem to be missing from those institutions that don't work
HowardRheingold_2005_109 i'm moving very quickly over a number of disciplines in biology the notions of symbiosis 
HowardRheingold_2005_110 group selection evolutionary psychology are contested to be sure
HowardRheingold_2005_111 but there is really no longer any major debate
HowardRheingold_2005_112 over the fact that cooperative arrangements have moved from a peripheral role to a central role in biology from the level
HowardRheingold_2005_113 of the cell to the level of the ecology and again our notions of individuals as economic beings
HowardRheingold_2005_114 have been overturned rational 
HowardRheingold_2005_115 not always the dominating factor in fact people
HowardRheingold_2005_116 will act to punish cheaters even at a cost to themselves and most recently
HowardRheingold_2005_117 neurophysiological measures have shown that people who punish cheaters in economic games
HowardRheingold_2005_118 show activity in the reward centers of their brain which led one scientist
HowardRheingold_2005_119 to declare that altruistic punishment
HowardRheingold_2005_120 may be the glue that holds societies
HowardRheingold_2005_121 i've been talking about how new forms of communication and new media in the past have helped create new economic forms 
HowardRheingold_2005_122 commerce is ancient markets are very old capitalism is fairly recent socialism emerged as a reaction to that
HowardRheingold_2005_123 and yet we see very little talk about how the next form may be emerging
HowardRheingold_2005_124 jim surowiecki briefly mentioned yochai benkler's paper about open source pointing to a new form of production peer to peer production 
HowardRheingold_2005_125 i simply want you to keep in mind that if in the past new forms of cooperation enabled by new technologies create new forms of wealth we may be 
HowardRheingold_2005_126 moving into yet another economic form that is significantly different from previous ones
HowardRheingold_2005_127 businesses ibm as you know hp sun some of the most
HowardRheingold_2005_128 fierce competitors in the it world are open sourcing
HowardRheingold_2005_129 their software are providing portfolios of patents for the commons 
HowardRheingold_2005_130 eli lilly in again the fiercely competitive pharmaceutical world has created a market for solutions
HowardRheingold_2005_131 for pharmaceutical problems 
HowardRheingold_2005_132 toyota 
HowardRheingold_2005_133 instead of treating its suppliers as a marketplace treats them as a network and trains them to produce better even though they are also training them 
HowardRheingold_2005_134 to produce better for their competitors now none of these companies are doing this out of
HowardRheingold_2005_135 doing it because they're learning that a certain kind of sharing is in their 
HowardRheingold_2005_136 open source production
HowardRheingold_2005_137 has shown us that world class software like linux and mozilla
HowardRheingold_2005_138 can be created with neither the bureaucratic structure of the firm
HowardRheingold_2005_139 nor the incentives of the marketplace as we've known them google enriches itself
HowardRheingold_2005_140 by enriching thousands of bloggers through adsense
HowardRheingold_2005_141 amazon has opened its application programming interface to sixty thousand developers 
HowardRheingold_2005_142 countless amazon shops they're enriching others not out of altruism but as a way of enriching 
HowardRheingold_2005_143 ebay solved the prisoner's dilemma and created a market where none would have
HowardRheingold_2005_144 existed by creating a feedback mechanism that turns a prisoner's dilemma game
HowardRheingold_2005_145 into an assurance game instead of neither of us can trust each other so we have to make suboptimal moves it's you
HowardRheingold_2005_146 prove to me that you are trustworthy and i will cooperate
HowardRheingold_2005_147 wikipedia has used thousands of volunteers to create a free encyclopedia
HowardRheingold_2005_148 with a million and a half articles in two hundred languages in just a couple of years
HowardRheingold_2005_149 we've seen that thinkcycle has enabled
HowardRheingold_2005_150 ngos
HowardRheingold_2005_151 in developing countries
HowardRheingold_2005_152 to put up problems to be solved by design students around the world including something that's being used for tsunami relief right now it's a mechanism for
HowardRheingold_2005_153 rehydrating cholera victims that's so simple to use it illiterates can be trained to use it 
HowardRheingold_2005_154 bittorrent turns every downloader into an uploader making the system more efficient the more it is used
HowardRheingold_2005_155 millions of people have contributed their desktop computers when they're not using them
HowardRheingold_2005_156 to link together through the internet into supercomputing collectives
HowardRheingold_2005_157 that help solve the protein folding problem for medical researchers that's folding @ home at stanford
HowardRheingold_2005_158 to crack codes to search for life in outer space 
HowardRheingold_2005_159 i don't think we know enough yet i don't think we've even begun to discover what the basic principles are but i think we can begin to think about them 
HowardRheingold_2005_160 and i don't have enough time to talk about all of them but think about
HowardRheingold_2005_161 this is all about self interest that adds up to more
HowardRheingold_2005_162 in el salvador both sides that withdrew from their civil war took moves that had been proven to mirror a prisoner's dilemma strategy
HowardRheingold_2005_163 in the u s in the philippines in kenya 
HowardRheingold_2005_164 around the world citizens have
HowardRheingold_2005_165 political protests and get out the vote campaigns using mobile devices and sms
HowardRheingold_2005_166 is an apollo project of cooperation possible a transdisciplinary study of cooperation i believe
HowardRheingold_2005_167 that the payoff would be very big i think we need to begin developing maps of this territory so that we can talk about it across disciplines
HowardRheingold_2005_168 and i am not saying that understanding cooperation is going to cause us to be better people
HowardRheingold_2005_169 and sometimes people cooperate to do bad things but i will remind you that a few hundred years ago people saw their loved ones die from diseases they thought 
HowardRheingold_2005_170 were caused by sin or foreigners or evil spirits
