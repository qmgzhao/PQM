HowardRheingold_2005_0 i'm here to enlist you
HowardRheingold_2005_2 here is the old story we've already heard a little bit about it biology
HowardRheingold_2005_5 and nations succeed only
HowardRheingold_2005_6 by defeating destroying and dominating
HowardRheingold_2005_10 it's a narrative spread across
HowardRheingold_2005_11 a number of different disciplines 
HowardRheingold_2005_12 survival of the fittest shrinks just a little bit to make room 
HowardRheingold_2005_17 in fact if you look back
HowardRheingold_2005_20 for quite a long time humans have lived for much much longer than the approximately ten thousand years of
HowardRheingold_2005_23 the form of wealth in those days was enough food to stay alive 
HowardRheingold_2005_26 they must have solved some collective action problems
HowardRheingold_2005_30 so that raised a social question that i believe must have driven new social forms
HowardRheingold_2005_32 how did they make arrangements again we can't know but
HowardRheingold_2005_36 that was owed and the taxes that was owed on them by making marks marks on clay in that time
HowardRheingold_2005_42 and from literate populations new forms of collective action emerged in in the spheres of knowledge
HowardRheingold_2005_43 and politics we saw scientific revolutions the protestant reformation constitutional democracies
HowardRheingold_2005_46 now commerce is ancient markets are as old as the crossroads 
HowardRheingold_2005_47 but capitalism as we know it is only a few hundred years old
HowardRheingold_2005_49 now of course the enabling technologies
HowardRheingold_2005_51 on the internet and in the
HowardRheingold_2005_52 era every desktop is now a printing press a broadcasting station a community
HowardRheingold_2005_54 evolution is speeding up
HowardRheingold_2005_55 more recently that power is untethering and leaping off the desktops and very very quickly
HowardRheingold_2005_59 now when i started looking into collective action the considerable literature on it
HowardRheingold_2005_60 is based on what sociologists call social dilemmas and there are a couple of mythic narratives of social dilemmas i'm going to
HowardRheingold_2005_64 so i'm just going to go over that very very quickly if you have more questions about it ask kevin kelly later
HowardRheingold_2005_65 laughter the prisoner's dilemma is actually a story that's overlaid on a mathematical matrix that came out of the game theory
HowardRheingold_2005_66 in the early years of thinking about nuclear war two players who couldn't trust each other 
HowardRheingold_2005_68 goods person with the money because they can't trust each other are not going to exchange neither one wants to be the first one
HowardRheingold_2005_71 twenty years ago robert axelrod used the prisoner's dilemma as a probe of the biological question
HowardRheingold_2005_80 and is asked to propose a split 
HowardRheingold_2005_83 players are paid and the game is over
HowardRheingold_2005_88 they were screened and didn't know about the game and had never played
HowardRheingold_2005_92 agriculturalists in the amazon or nomadic pastoralists in central asia or a dozen different cultures each had radically
HowardRheingold_2005_93 different ideas of what is fair which suggests that instead of there being an innate sense of fairness that somehow the basis of our economic transactions transactions
HowardRheingold_2005_95 our social institutions whether we know that or not the other major narrative of social dilemmas is the tragedy of the commons
HowardRheingold_2005_96 garrett hardin used it to talk about overpopulation in the late 1960s he used the
HowardRheingold_2005_102 of humans sharing watersheds forestry resources fisheries and discovered that yes in case after case humans
HowardRheingold_2005_103 destroyed the commons that they depended on but she also found many instances in which people escaped the prisoner's dilemma
HowardRheingold_2005_107 among those institutions that worked there were a number of common design principles
HowardRheingold_2005_108 and those principles seem to be missing from those institutions that don't work
HowardRheingold_2005_109 i'm moving very quickly over a number of disciplines in biology the notions of symbiosis 
HowardRheingold_2005_112 over the fact that cooperative arrangements have moved from a peripheral role to a central role in biology from the level
HowardRheingold_2005_113 of the cell to the level of the ecology and again our notions of individuals as economic beings
HowardRheingold_2005_115 not always the dominating factor in fact people
HowardRheingold_2005_116 will act to punish cheaters even at a cost to themselves and most recently
HowardRheingold_2005_117 neurophysiological measures have shown that people who punish cheaters in economic games
HowardRheingold_2005_120 may be the glue that holds societies
HowardRheingold_2005_124 jim surowiecki briefly mentioned yochai benkler's paper about open source pointing to a new form of production peer to peer production 
HowardRheingold_2005_127 businesses ibm as you know hp sun some of the most
HowardRheingold_2005_130 eli lilly in again the fiercely competitive pharmaceutical world has created a market for solutions
HowardRheingold_2005_132 toyota 
HowardRheingold_2005_133 instead of treating its suppliers as a marketplace treats them as a network and trains them to produce better even though they are also training them 
HowardRheingold_2005_135 doing it because they're learning that a certain kind of sharing is in their 
HowardRheingold_2005_137 has shown us that world class software like linux and mozilla
HowardRheingold_2005_142 countless amazon shops they're enriching others not out of altruism but as a way of enriching 
HowardRheingold_2005_143 ebay solved the prisoner's dilemma and created a market where none would have
HowardRheingold_2005_144 existed by creating a feedback mechanism that turns a prisoner's dilemma game
HowardRheingold_2005_148 with a million and a half articles in two hundred languages in just a couple of years
HowardRheingold_2005_149 we've seen that thinkcycle has enabled
HowardRheingold_2005_154 bittorrent turns every downloader into an uploader making the system more efficient the more it is used
HowardRheingold_2005_160 and i don't have enough time to talk about all of them but think about
HowardRheingold_2005_161 this is all about self interest that adds up to more
HowardRheingold_2005_163 in the u s in the philippines in kenya 
HowardRheingold_2005_165 political protests and get out the vote campaigns using mobile devices and sms
HowardRheingold_2005_166 is an apollo project of cooperation possible a transdisciplinary study of cooperation i believe
HowardRheingold_2005_168 and i am not saying that understanding cooperation is going to cause us to be better people
