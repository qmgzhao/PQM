HowardRheingold_2005_1 in helping reshape the story about how humans and other critters get things
HowardRheingold_2005_7 is about your side winning
HowardRheingold_2005_9 but i think we can see the very beginnings of a new story beginning to emerge
HowardRheingold_2005_13 i started thinking about the relationship between
HowardRheingold_2005_15 media and
HowardRheingold_2005_18 human communication media and
HowardRheingold_2005_19 the ways in which we organize
HowardRheingold_2005_21 settled agricultural civilization
HowardRheingold_2005_22 in small family groups nomadic hunters bring down rabbits gathering food
HowardRheingold_2005_24 but at some point
HowardRheingold_2005_25 they banded together to hunt bigger game and we don't know exactly how they did this although
HowardRheingold_2005_31 did the people who ate that mastodon meat owe something to the hunters and their families and
HowardRheingold_2005_35 who began hiring people to keep track of the wheat and sheep and wine
HowardRheingold_2005_41 millions of people became literate 
HowardRheingold_2005_53 or a marketplace 
HowardRheingold_2005_56 to see a significant proportion if not the majority of the human race walking around
HowardRheingold_2005_57 holding 
HowardRheingold_2005_58 carrying or wearing supercomputers linked at speeds greater than what we consider to be broadband today 
HowardRheingold_2005_62 now when i talked about this with kevin kelly he assured me that everybody in this audience
HowardRheingold_2005_63 pretty much knows the details of the prisoner's dilemma
HowardRheingold_2005_67 let me just say that every unsecured transaction is a good example of a prisoner's dilemma person with the
HowardRheingold_2005_69 or they're going to get the sucker's payoff but both lose of course because they don't get what they want if they could only agree if they could only turn a prisoner's dilemma into
HowardRheingold_2005_70 a different payoff matrix called an assurance game they could proceed
HowardRheingold_2005_72 if we are here because our ancestors were such fierce competitors how does cooperation exist at all he started a computer tournament for people to submit prisoner
HowardRheingold_2005_73 's dilemma strategies and discovered much to his surprise that a very very simple strategy won
HowardRheingold_2005_74 it won the first tournament and even after everyone knew it won
HowardRheingold_2005_76 another economic game that may not be as well known as the prisoner's dilemma is the ultimatum game
HowardRheingold_2005_77 and it's also a very interesting probe of our assumptions about
HowardRheingold_2005_78 the way people make economic transactions here's how the game is played
HowardRheingold_2005_82 either accepts the split both
HowardRheingold_2005_85 now the fundamental basis of neoclassical economics would tell you it's irrational to reject a dollar because someone you don't know in another room is
HowardRheingold_2005_86 going to get ninety nine yet in thousands of trials with american and european and japanese students
HowardRheingold_2005_90 now the interesting part comes in more recently when anthropologists began taking this game to other cultures
HowardRheingold_2005_94 can be influenced by
HowardRheingold_2005_98 by simply maximizing their own flock led to overgrazing and the depletion of the resource he had the rather gloomy conclusion that humans will inevitably despoil any common pool resource
HowardRheingold_2005_100 now elinor ostrom a political scientist in one thousand nine hundred and ninety ninety asked the interesting question that any good scientist should ask which is is
HowardRheingold_2005_101 it really true that humans will always despoil commons so she went out and looked at what data she could find she looked at thousands of
HowardRheingold_2005_104 the tragedy of the commons is a multiplayer prisoner's dilemma and she said that people are only prisoners
HowardRheingold_2005_105 if they consider themselves to be
HowardRheingold_2005_106 they escape by creating institutions for collective action and she discovered i think most interestingly that
HowardRheingold_2005_110 group selection evolutionary psychology are contested to be sure
HowardRheingold_2005_111 but there is really no longer any major debate
HowardRheingold_2005_114 have been overturned rational 
HowardRheingold_2005_118 show activity in the reward centers of their brain which led one scientist
HowardRheingold_2005_119 to declare that altruistic punishment
HowardRheingold_2005_121 i've been talking about how new forms of communication and new media in the past have helped create new economic forms 
HowardRheingold_2005_122 commerce is ancient markets are very old capitalism is fairly recent socialism emerged as a reaction to that
HowardRheingold_2005_123 and yet we see very little talk about how the next form may be emerging
HowardRheingold_2005_126 moving into yet another economic form that is significantly different from previous ones
HowardRheingold_2005_129 their software are providing portfolios of patents for the commons 
HowardRheingold_2005_131 for pharmaceutical problems 
HowardRheingold_2005_136 open source production
HowardRheingold_2005_138 can be created with neither the bureaucratic structure of the firm
HowardRheingold_2005_140 by enriching thousands of bloggers through adsense
HowardRheingold_2005_141 amazon has opened its application programming interface to sixty thousand developers 
HowardRheingold_2005_145 into an assurance game instead of neither of us can trust each other so we have to make suboptimal moves it's you
HowardRheingold_2005_146 prove to me that you are trustworthy and i will cooperate
HowardRheingold_2005_147 wikipedia has used thousands of volunteers to create a free encyclopedia
HowardRheingold_2005_150 ngos
HowardRheingold_2005_153 rehydrating cholera victims that's so simple to use it illiterates can be trained to use it 
HowardRheingold_2005_155 millions of people have contributed their desktop computers when they're not using them
HowardRheingold_2005_156 to link together through the internet into supercomputing collectives
HowardRheingold_2005_157 that help solve the protein folding problem for medical researchers that's folding @ home at stanford
HowardRheingold_2005_158 to crack codes to search for life in outer space 
HowardRheingold_2005_159 i don't think we know enough yet i don't think we've even begun to discover what the basic principles are but i think we can begin to think about them 
HowardRheingold_2005_162 in el salvador both sides that withdrew from their civil war took moves that had been proven to mirror a prisoner's dilemma strategy
HowardRheingold_2005_164 around the world citizens have
HowardRheingold_2005_169 and sometimes people cooperate to do bad things but i will remind you that a few hundred years ago people saw their loved ones die from diseases they thought
