BenDunlap_2007_1 few would have imagined much of a future even a century or two ago but
BenDunlap_2007_3 somebody here must surely know because despite the fact that there aren't that many hungarians to begin with and the further fact that so far as i know there's not a drop of hungarian blood in my veins at every critical juncture of my life
BenDunlap_2007_7 that has befallen many a hungarian town and village throughout its long and troubled history or maybe it's because when i was a teenager back in the' 50s my uncle henry having 
BenDunlap_2007_9 and went back to south carolina to face down the klan alone that was a very hungarian thing to do as anyone will attest who remembers 
BenDunlap_2007_12 but ultimately
BenDunlap_2007_13 i ascribe it to an admiration for people with a complex moral awareness with a heritage of guilt and defeat matched by defiance and bravado it's not a typical mindset for most americans 
BenDunlap_2007_14 but it is perforce typical of virtually all hungarians so j napot pack
BenDunlap_2007_16 the reckless condescension of that era thinking i would save my people
BenDunlap_2007_17 never mind the fact that they were slow to acknowledge they needed saving i labored in that vineyard for a quarter century before making my way to a little kingdom of the just in upstate south carolina
BenDunlap_2007_18 institution of higher learning called wofford college i knew nothing about wofford and even less about methodism 
BenDunlap_2007_25 a condition which in those days required institutionalization
BenDunlap_2007_26 and a succession of painful operations between the ages of one and eleven
BenDunlap_2007_28 and there he was as smart as he was modest and he enjoyed a considerable success and after graduation when he went into textile engineering the success continued he built one plant after another he married
BenDunlap_2007_30 once as he had left instructions to have done he was summoned in the middle of the night by the night watchman at one of his plants
BenDunlap_2007_32 and confronted the thief and said
BenDunlap_2007_34 the night watchman seeing how things were going and waxing indignant said well we're going to call the police aren't we
BenDunlap_2007_35 but mr teszler answered no that will not be necessary he will not steal from us again well
BenDunlap_2007_36 maybe he was too
BenDunlap_2007_37 because he stayed where he was long after the nazi anschluss in austria
BenDunlap_2007_41 it was handcrafted
BenDunlap_2007_42 brutality people were beaten to death and their bodies tossed into the river but none who entered that death house had ever come out alive and in a twist
BenDunlap_2007_43 you would not believe in a steven spielberg film
BenDunlap_2007_46 midway through
BenDunlap_2007_48 and the gauleiter who afterwards vanishes from this story leaned down
BenDunlap_2007_52 probably mr teszler had gotten some money into swiss bank accounts
BenDunlap_2007_53 because he managed to take his family first to great britain then to long island and then to the center of the textile industry in the american south
BenDunlap_2007_54 which as chance would have it was spartanburg south carolina
BenDunlap_2007_62 buy us some land in kings mountain and announce we are going to build a major plant there
BenDunlap_2007_65 the white mayor visited mr teszler and said mr teszler i trust youre going to be hiring a lot of white workers
BenDunlap_2007_67 and if they are good enough i will hire them
BenDunlap_2007_69 you bring the best workers that you can find and if they are good enough 
BenDunlap_2007_75 he gathered them together after an initial tour of that facility and he asked if there were any questions there was hemming and hawing and shuffling of feet and then one of the white workers stepped forward and said
BenDunlap_2007_76 's only one place to eat there's only one bathroom there's only one water fountain is this plant going to be integrated or what
BenDunlap_2007_78 do you have any other questions no i reckon i don't
BenDunlap_2007_86 having retired from the textile industry adopted wofford college auditing courses every semester
BenDunlap_2007_90 because he was so conspicuously wiser
BenDunlap_2007_91 than any one of us
BenDunlap_2007_92 to me it was immensely reassuring that the presiding spirit of this little methodist college in upstate south carolina
BenDunlap_2007_97 opened his cloak to embrace the knight
BenDunlap_2007_101 and on the first occasion that i visited his house he gave me honor of deciding what piece of music we would listen to and i delighted
BenDunlap_2007_103 i love bartok's music as did mr teszler and he had virtually every recording of bartok's music
BenDunlap_2007_108 marked adagio religioso he incorporated the sounds of birdsong that he heard outside his window in what he knew would be his last
BenDunlap_2007_110 for her
BenDunlap_2007_114 whenever you hear this
BenDunlap_2007_116 it was only after
BenDunlap_2007_118 that i learned that the marker on the grave of bela bartok in hartsdale new york was paid for by sandor teszler
BenDunlap_2007_119 j napot bela not long before mr teszlers own death at the age of ninety seven he heard me hold forth on human
BenDunlap_2007_125 released me from my vow and now he's dead so i'm stuck with my vow j
BenDunlap_2007_127 i met francis robicsek a hungarian
BenDunlap_2007_129 surgery and tinkering away in his garage behind his house had invented many of the devices that are standard parts of those procedures
BenDunlap_2007_131 dutch art and hungarian painting and when he came to this country moving on to spanish colonial art russian icons and finally mayan
BenDunlap_2007_133 on the occasion of my first visit we toured his house and we saw hundreds of works of museum quality and then we paused in front of a closed
BenDunlap_2007_135 alone until i let them have a piece but it was not a good one
BenDunlap_2007_136 well it occurred to me that i should invite dr robicsek to lecture at wofford college on what else 
BenDunlap_2007_138 largest privately owned textile empire with an iron hand his name is roger milliken
BenDunlap_2007_143 and what they were arguing about was this
BenDunlap_2007_144 whether the second harry potter
BenDunlap_2007_149 but i'll bet you went to the movie with a grandchild well yes i did conceded mr milliken aha said dr robicsek i went to the movie all by myself
BenDunlap_2007_150 and i realized in this moment of revelation that what these two men were revealing was the secret of their extraordinary success each in his own right
BenDunlap_2007_152 that irrepressible desire to know no matter what the subject no matter what the cost even at a time when the keepers of the doomsday clock are willing to bet even money
BenDunlap_2007_153 that the human race won't be around to imagine anything in the year two thousand one hundred a scant ninety three years from
BenDunlap_2007_154 each day as if it is your last said mahatma gandhi learn as if you'll live forever
BenDunlap_2007_155 this is what i'm passionate about it is precisely this it is
BenDunlap_2007_156 this
