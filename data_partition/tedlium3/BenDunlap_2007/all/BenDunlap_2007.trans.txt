BenDunlap_2007_0 language spoken by hungarians for which given the fact that cognitive diversity is at least as threatened as biodiversity on this planet
BenDunlap_2007_1 few would have imagined much of a future even a century or two ago but
BenDunlap_2007_2 there it is j napot pack i said
BenDunlap_2007_3 somebody here must surely know because despite the fact that there aren't that many hungarians to begin with and the further fact that so far as i know there's not a drop of hungarian blood in my veins at every critical juncture of my life
BenDunlap_2007_4 there has been a hungarian friend or mentor there beside me i even have dreams that take place in landscapes i recognize as the landscapes of hungarian films especially the early movies of miklos jancso so
BenDunlap_2007_5 how do i explain this mysterious affinity maybe it's because my native state of south carolina which is not much smaller than present day hungary 
BenDunlap_2007_6 once imagined a future for itself as an independent country and as a consequence of that presumption my hometown was burned to the ground by an invading army an experience 
BenDunlap_2007_7 that has befallen many a hungarian town and village throughout its long and troubled history or maybe it's because when i was a teenager back in the' 50s my uncle henry having 
BenDunlap_2007_8 denounced the ku klux klan and been bombed for his trouble and had crosses burned in his yard living under death threat took his wife and children to massachusetts for safety
BenDunlap_2007_9 and went back to south carolina to face down the klan alone that was a very hungarian thing to do as anyone will attest who remembers 
BenDunlap_2007_10 and of course from time to time hungarians have invented their own equivalent of the klan well it seems to me
BenDunlap_2007_11 that this hungarian presence in my life is difficult to account for
BenDunlap_2007_12 but ultimately
BenDunlap_2007_13 i ascribe it to an admiration for people with a complex moral awareness with a heritage of guilt and defeat matched by defiance and bravado it's not a typical mindset for most americans 
BenDunlap_2007_14 but it is perforce typical of virtually all hungarians so j napot pack
BenDunlap_2007_15 i went back to south carolina after some fifteen years amid the alien corn at the tail end of the 
BenDunlap_2007_16 the reckless condescension of that era thinking i would save my people
BenDunlap_2007_17 never mind the fact that they were slow to acknowledge they needed saving i labored in that vineyard for a quarter century before making my way to a little kingdom of the just in upstate south carolina
BenDunlap_2007_18 institution of higher learning called wofford college i knew nothing about wofford and even less about methodism 
BenDunlap_2007_19 but i was reassured on the first day that i taught at wofford college to find among the auditors in my classroom a 90 year old hungarian
BenDunlap_2007_20 surrounded by a bevy of middle aged european women who seemed to function as an entourage of rhinemaidens his name was sandor teszler
BenDunlap_2007_21 he was a puckish widower whose wife and children were dead
BenDunlap_2007_22 and whose grandchildren lived far away in appearance he resembled mahatma gandhi minus the loincloth plus orthopedic boots
BenDunlap_2007_23 he had been born in one thousand nine hundred and three in the provinces of the old austro hungarian empire in what later would become yugoslavia
BenDunlap_2007_24 he was ostracized as a child not because he was a jew his parents weren't very religious anyhow but because he had been born with two club feet
BenDunlap_2007_25 a condition which in those days required institutionalization
BenDunlap_2007_26 and a succession of painful operations between the ages of one and eleven
BenDunlap_2007_27 he went to the commercial business high school as a young man in budapest
BenDunlap_2007_28 and there he was as smart as he was modest and he enjoyed a considerable success and after graduation when he went into textile engineering the success continued he built one plant after another he married
BenDunlap_2007_29 and had two sons he had friends in high places who assured him that he was of great value to the economy 
BenDunlap_2007_30 once as he had left instructions to have done he was summoned in the middle of the night by the night watchman at one of his plants
BenDunlap_2007_31 the night watchman had caught an employee who was stealing socks it was a hosiery mill and he simply backed a truck up to the loading dock and was shoveling in mountains of socks mr teszler went down to the plant
BenDunlap_2007_32 and confronted the thief and said
BenDunlap_2007_33 but why do you steal from me if you need money you have only to ask
BenDunlap_2007_34 the night watchman seeing how things were going and waxing indignant said well we're going to call the police aren't we
BenDunlap_2007_35 but mr teszler answered no that will not be necessary he will not steal from us again well
BenDunlap_2007_36 maybe he was too
BenDunlap_2007_37 because he stayed where he was long after the nazi anschluss in austria
BenDunlap_2007_38 and even after the arrests and deportations began in budapest
BenDunlap_2007_39 he took the simple precaution of having cyanide capsules placed in lockets that could be worn about the necks of himself and his family 
BenDunlap_2007_40 and then one day it happened he and his family were arrested and they were taken to a death house on the danube in those early days of the final
BenDunlap_2007_41 it was handcrafted
BenDunlap_2007_42 brutality people were beaten to death and their bodies tossed into the river but none who entered that death house had ever come out alive and in a twist
BenDunlap_2007_43 you would not believe in a steven spielberg film
BenDunlap_2007_44 the gauleiter who was overseeing this brutal beating was the very same thief who had stolen socks from mr teszler's hosiery mill 
BenDunlap_2007_45 it was a brutal beating
BenDunlap_2007_46 midway through
BenDunlap_2007_47 that brutality one of mr teszler's sons andrew looked up and said is it time to take the capsule now papa
BenDunlap_2007_48 and the gauleiter who afterwards vanishes from this story leaned down
BenDunlap_2007_49 and whispered into mr teszler's ear no do not take the capsule
BenDunlap_2007_50 help is on the way and then resumed the beating but help help was on the way and shortly afterwards a car arrived from the swiss embassy they were spirited to safety they were reclassified as yugoslav
BenDunlap_2007_51 citizens and they managed to stay one step ahead of their pursuers for the duration of the war surviving burnings and bombings and at the end of the war arrest by the soviets 
BenDunlap_2007_52 probably mr teszler had gotten some money into swiss bank accounts
BenDunlap_2007_53 because he managed to take his family first to great britain then to long island and then to the center of the textile industry in the american south
BenDunlap_2007_54 which as chance would have it was spartanburg south carolina
BenDunlap_2007_55 the location of wofford college and there mr teszler
BenDunlap_2007_56 began all over again
BenDunlap_2007_57 and once again achieved immense success especially after he invented the process for manufacturing a new fabric called double knit and then
BenDunlap_2007_58 then in the late 1950s in the aftermath of brown v board of education when the klan was resurgent all over the south
BenDunlap_2007_59 i have heard this talk before and he called his top assistant to him
BenDunlap_2007_60 and asked where would you say in this region 
BenDunlap_2007_61 racism is most virulent well i don't rightly know mr teszler i reckon that would be kings mountain good
BenDunlap_2007_62 buy us some land in kings mountain and announce we are going to build a major plant there
BenDunlap_2007_63 the man did as he was told and shortly afterwards
BenDunlap_2007_64 teszler received a visit from the white mayor of kings mountain now you should know that at that time the textile industry in the south was notoriously segregated
BenDunlap_2007_65 the white mayor visited mr teszler and said mr teszler i trust youre going to be hiring a lot of white workers
BenDunlap_2007_66 mr teszler told him you bring me the best workers that you can
BenDunlap_2007_67 and if they are good enough i will hire them
BenDunlap_2007_68 he also received a visit from the leader of the black community a minister who said mr teszler i sure hope you're going to hire some black workers for this new plant of yours he got the same answer
BenDunlap_2007_69 you bring the best workers that you can find and if they are good enough 
BenDunlap_2007_70 i will hire them
BenDunlap_2007_71 as it happens the black minister did his job better than the white mayor but that's neither here or there mr teszler hired sixteen men 
BenDunlap_2007_72 be his seed group his future foremen
BenDunlap_2007_73 he had installed the heavy equipment for his new process in an abandoned store in the vicinity of kings mountain
BenDunlap_2007_74 and for two months these sixteen men would live and work together mastering the new process
BenDunlap_2007_75 he gathered them together after an initial tour of that facility and he asked if there were any questions there was hemming and hawing and shuffling of feet and then one of the white workers stepped forward and said
BenDunlap_2007_76 's only one place to eat there's only one bathroom there's only one water fountain is this plant going to be integrated or what
BenDunlap_2007_77 mr teszler said you are being paid twice the wages of any other textile workers in this region and this is how we do business
BenDunlap_2007_78 do you have any other questions no i reckon i don't
BenDunlap_2007_79 and two months later
BenDunlap_2007_80 when the main plant opened and hundreds of new workers white and
BenDunlap_2007_81 black poured in to see the facility for the first time they were met by the sixteen foremen white and black standing shoulder to shoulder 
BenDunlap_2007_82 they toured the facility and were asked if there were any questions and inevitably the same question arose is this plant integrated or what
BenDunlap_2007_83 and one of the white foremen stepped forward and said you are being paid twice the wages of any other workers in this industry in this region
BenDunlap_2007_84 and this is how we do business do you have any other questions and there were none
BenDunlap_2007_85 in one fell swoop mr teszler had integrated the textile industry in that part of the south it was an achievement worthy of mahatma gandhi conducted with the shrewdness of a lawyer and the idealism of a saint
BenDunlap_2007_86 having retired from the textile industry adopted wofford college auditing courses every semester
BenDunlap_2007_87 and because he had a tendency to kiss anything that moved becoming affectionately known 
BenDunlap_2007_88 by all and sundry before i got there the library of the college had been named for mr teszler and after i arrived in one thousand nine hundred and ninety three
BenDunlap_2007_89 the faculty decided to honor itself by naming mr teszler professor of the college partly because at that point he had already taken all of the courses in the catalog but mainly
BenDunlap_2007_90 because he was so conspicuously wiser
BenDunlap_2007_91 than any one of us
BenDunlap_2007_92 to me it was immensely reassuring that the presiding spirit of this little methodist college in upstate south carolina
BenDunlap_2007_93 was a holocaust survivor from central europe
BenDunlap_2007_94 he was indeed but he also had a wonderful sense of humor and once for an interdisciplinary class i was screening the opening segment of ingmar bergman's the seventh seal as the medieval knight antonius block returns from the wild goose chase of the crusades
BenDunlap_2007_95 and arrives on the rocky shore of sweden only to find the specter of death waiting for him
BenDunlap_2007_96 teszler sat in the dark with his fellow students and as death
BenDunlap_2007_97 opened his cloak to embrace the knight
BenDunlap_2007_98 in a ghastly embrace i heard mr teszler's tremulous voice uh oh he said
BenDunlap_2007_99 this doesn't look so good
BenDunlap_2007_100 but it was music that was his greatest passion especially opera
BenDunlap_2007_101 and on the first occasion that i visited his house he gave me honor of deciding what piece of music we would listen to and i delighted
BenDunlap_2007_102 him by rejecting cavalleria rusticana in favor of bela bartok's bluebeard's castle
BenDunlap_2007_103 i love bartok's music as did mr teszler and he had virtually every recording of bartok's music
BenDunlap_2007_104 ever issued and it was at his house that i heard for the first time bartok's third piano concerto and learned from mr teszler
BenDunlap_2007_105 that it had been composed in nearby asheville north carolina in the last year of the
BenDunlap_2007_106 composer's life he was dying of leukemia and he knew it
BenDunlap_2007_107 and he dedicated this concerto to his wife dita who was herself a concert pianist and into the slow second movement 
BenDunlap_2007_108 marked adagio religioso he incorporated the sounds of birdsong that he heard outside his window in what he knew would be his last
BenDunlap_2007_109 he was imagining a future
BenDunlap_2007_110 for her
BenDunlap_2007_111 in which he would play no part
BenDunlap_2007_112 and clearly clearly this composition is his final statement to her it was first performed after his death
BenDunlap_2007_113 and through her to the world and just as clearly it is saying it's okay it was all so beautiful
BenDunlap_2007_114 whenever you hear this
BenDunlap_2007_115 i will be there
BenDunlap_2007_116 it was only after
BenDunlap_2007_117 teszler's death
BenDunlap_2007_118 that i learned that the marker on the grave of bela bartok in hartsdale new york was paid for by sandor teszler
BenDunlap_2007_119 j napot bela not long before mr teszlers own death at the age of ninety seven he heard me hold forth on human
BenDunlap_2007_120 i delivered a lecture in which i described history as on the whole a tidal wave of human suffering and brutality and mr teszler came up to me afterwards
BenDunlap_2007_121 with gentle reproach and said you know doctor human beings are fundamentally good
BenDunlap_2007_122 and i made a vow to myself then and there that if this man who had such cause to think otherwise had reached that conclusion
BenDunlap_2007_123 i would not presume to differ
BenDunlap_2007_124 until he
BenDunlap_2007_125 released me from my vow and now he's dead so i'm stuck with my vow j
BenDunlap_2007_126 napot sandor i thought my skein of hungarian mentors had come to an end but almost immediately
BenDunlap_2007_127 i met francis robicsek a hungarian
BenDunlap_2007_128 doctor actually a heart surgeon in charlotte north carolina then in his late seventies who had been a pioneer in
BenDunlap_2007_129 surgery and tinkering away in his garage behind his house had invented many of the devices that are standard parts of those procedures
BenDunlap_2007_130 he's also a prodigious art collector beginning as an intern in budapest by collecting 
BenDunlap_2007_131 dutch art and hungarian painting and when he came to this country moving on to spanish colonial art russian icons and finally mayan
BenDunlap_2007_132 ceramics he's the author of seven books six of them on mayan ceramics it was he who broke the mayan codex enabling scholars to relate the pictographs on mayan ceramics to the hieroglyphs of the mayan script
BenDunlap_2007_133 on the occasion of my first visit we toured his house and we saw hundreds of works of museum quality and then we paused in front of a closed
BenDunlap_2007_134 with shelves from floor to ceiling and crammed on every shelf his collection of mayan ceramics now i know absolutely nothing about mayan ceramics but i wanted to be as ingratiating as possible so i said
BenDunlap_2007_135 alone until i let them have a piece but it was not a good one
BenDunlap_2007_136 well it occurred to me that i should invite dr robicsek to lecture at wofford college on what else 
BenDunlap_2007_137 i should invite him to meet my oldest trustee who had majored in french history at yale some
BenDunlap_2007_138 largest privately owned textile empire with an iron hand his name is roger milliken
BenDunlap_2007_139 and mr milliken agreed and dr robicsek agreed and dr robicsek visited and delivered the lecture and it was a dazzling success and afterwards we convened at the president's house with dr robicsek on one hand mr milliken on the other
BenDunlap_2007_140 and it was only at that moment as we were sitting down to dinner that i recognized the enormity of the risk i had created because to bring these two titans these two masters of the universe together
BenDunlap_2007_141 it was like introducing mothra to godzilla over the skyline of tokyo if they didn't like each other we could all get trampled to death but they did they did like each other
BenDunlap_2007_142 they got along famously until the very end of the meal and then they got into a furious argument
BenDunlap_2007_143 and what they were arguing about was this
BenDunlap_2007_144 whether the second harry potter
BenDunlap_2007_145 movie was as good as the first mr
BenDunlap_2007_146 milliken said it was not dr robicsek disagreed
BenDunlap_2007_147 i was still trying to take in the notion that these titans these masters of the universe in their spare time watch harry potter movies when mr milliken thought he would win the argument by saying you just think it's so good because you didn't read the
BenDunlap_2007_148 robicsek reeled back in his chair but quickly gathered his wits leaned forward and said well that is true 
BenDunlap_2007_149 but i'll bet you went to the movie with a grandchild well yes i did conceded mr milliken aha said dr robicsek i went to the movie all by myself
BenDunlap_2007_150 and i realized in this moment of revelation that what these two men were revealing was the secret of their extraordinary success each in his own right
BenDunlap_2007_151 and it lay precisely in that insatiable curiosity
BenDunlap_2007_152 that irrepressible desire to know no matter what the subject no matter what the cost even at a time when the keepers of the doomsday clock are willing to bet even money
BenDunlap_2007_153 that the human race won't be around to imagine anything in the year two thousand one hundred a scant ninety three years from
BenDunlap_2007_154 each day as if it is your last said mahatma gandhi learn as if you'll live forever
BenDunlap_2007_155 this is what i'm passionate about it is precisely this it is
BenDunlap_2007_156 this
BenDunlap_2007_157 inextinguishable undaunted appetite for learning and experience no matter how risible no matter how esoteric no matter how seditious it might seem
BenDunlap_2007_158 this defines the imagined futures of our
BenDunlap_2007_159 fellow hungarians robicsek teszler and bartok as it does
