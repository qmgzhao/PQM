EvaVertes_2005_0 a privilege to be here spending my last day as a teenager today i want to talk to you about the future but first i
EvaVertes_2005_1 tell you a bit about the past
EvaVertes_2005_2 my story starts way before i was born my grandmother was on a train to auschwitz the death death camp and
EvaVertes_2005_3 she was going along the tracks and the
EvaVertes_2005_4 the tracks split and somehow we don't really know exactly the whole story but the train took the wrong track and went to a
EvaVertes_2005_5 work camp rather than the death camp
EvaVertes_2005_6 my grandmother survived
EvaVertes_2005_7 and
EvaVertes_2005_8 married my grandfather they were living in hungary and my mother was born and when my mother was two years old the hungarian revolution
EvaVertes_2005_9 was raging and they decided to escape hungary 
EvaVertes_2005_10 they got on a boat and yet another divergence the boat was either going to canada or to australia they got on and didn't know where they were going and ended up in
EvaVertes_2005_11 to make a long story short they came to canada my grandmother was a chemist she worked at the banting institute in toronto
EvaVertes_2005_12 and at forty four she died of stomach cancer
EvaVertes_2005_13 i never met my grandmother but i carry on her name
EvaVertes_2005_14 her exact name eva vertes
EvaVertes_2005_15 and i like to think i carry on her scientific passion too i found this passion not far from here actually when i was nine years old
EvaVertes_2005_16 my family was on a road trip and
EvaVertes_2005_17 we were in the grand canyon and
EvaVertes_2005_18 i had never been a reader when i was young my dad had tried me with the hardy boys i tried nancy drew i tried all that and i just didn't like reading books 
EvaVertes_2005_19 and my mother bought this book when we were at the grand canyon called the hot zone it was all about
EvaVertes_2005_20 the outbreak of the ebola virus and something about it just kind of drew me towards it there was this big sort of bumpy looking virus on the cover and
EvaVertes_2005_21 i just wanted to read it i picked up that book and as we drove from the edge of the grand canyon to big sur and to actually here where we are today in monterey 
EvaVertes_2005_22 i read that book and from
EvaVertes_2005_23 when i was reading that book i knew that i wanted to have a life
EvaVertes_2005_24 i wanted to be like the explorers i'd read about in the book who
EvaVertes_2005_25 went into the jungles of africa went into the research labs and just tried to figure out what this deadly virus was
EvaVertes_2005_26 so from that moment on i read every medical book i could get my hands on
EvaVertes_2005_27 and i just loved it so much i was a passive observer observer of the medical world it wasn't until i entered high
EvaVertes_2005_28 maybe now you know being a big high school kid i can maybe become an active part of this big medical world 
EvaVertes_2005_29 i was fourteen and i emailed professors at the
EvaVertes_2005_30 local university to see if maybe i could go work in their lab and hardly anyone responded but i mean why would they respond to a 14 year old anyway 
EvaVertes_2005_31 and i got to go talk to one professor dr jacobs who accepted me into the lab
EvaVertes_2005_32 at that time i was really interested in neuroscience and wanted to do a research project in neurology specifically looking at
EvaVertes_2005_33 the effects of heavy metals on the developing nervous system so
EvaVertes_2005_34 i started that and
EvaVertes_2005_35 worked in his lab for a year and
EvaVertes_2005_36 found the results that i guess you'd expect to find when you feed fruit flies heavy metals that it really really impaired the nervous system
EvaVertes_2005_37 spinal cord had breaks the neurons were crossing
EvaVertes_2005_38 in every which way and from then i wanted to look not at impairment but at prevention of impairment
EvaVertes_2005_39 so that's what led me to alzheimer's
EvaVertes_2005_40 i started reading about alzheimer's and tried to familiarize myself with the research
EvaVertes_2005_41 and at the same time when i was in the i was reading in the medical library one day and i read this article about something called
EvaVertes_2005_42 and they seemed to have cell 
EvaVertes_2005_43 properties and being naive about the whole field i kind of thought oh you have cell death in alzheimer's which is causing the memory deficit and then you have
EvaVertes_2005_44 this compound purine derivatives that are promoting cell growth and so i thought maybe if it can promote cell
EvaVertes_2005_45 the project that i
EvaVertes_2005_46 pursued for that year and it's continuing now as well and found that
EvaVertes_2005_47 a specific purine derivative called guanidine had inhibited the cell growth by approximately sixty percent so i presented
EvaVertes_2005_48 those results at the international science fair which was just one of the most amazing experiences of my life and there i was
EvaVertes_2005_49 best in the world in medicine which
EvaVertes_2005_50 allowed me to get in or at least get get a foot in the door of the big medical world
EvaVertes_2005_51 and
EvaVertes_2005_52 from then on since i was now in this huge exciting world 
EvaVertes_2005_53 i wanted to explore it all i wanted it all at once but knew i couldn't really get that
EvaVertes_2005_54 and i stumbled across something called cancer stem cells and this is really what i want to talk to you about today about cancer
EvaVertes_2005_55 at first when i heard of cancer stem cells
EvaVertes_2005_56 i didn't really know how to put the two together i'd heard of stem cells and i'd heard of them as the panacea of the future the therapy of many diseases to come in the future perhaps
EvaVertes_2005_57 but i'd heard of cancer as the most feared disease of our time so how did the good and bad go together
EvaVertes_2005_58 last summer i worked at stanford university doing some research on cancer stem cells and while i was doing
EvaVertes_2005_59 this i was reading the cancer literature trying to again familiarize myself with this new medical field and it seemed that
EvaVertes_2005_60 that tumors actually begin from a stem cell this fascinated me 
EvaVertes_2005_61 the more i read the more i looked at cancer differently and almost became less fearful of it
EvaVertes_2005_62 it seems that cancer is a direct result to injury if you smoke you damage your lung tissue and then
EvaVertes_2005_63 lung cancer arises if you drink you damage your liver and then liver cancer occurs
EvaVertes_2005_64 and it was really interesting there were articles correlating if you have a bone fracture and then bone cancer arises
EvaVertes_2005_65 these phenomenal cells
EvaVertes_2005_66 that really have the ability to differentiate into any type of tissue so if the body is sensing that you have damage to an organ
EvaVertes_2005_67 and then it's initiating cancer it's almost as if this is a repair response and the cancer the body is saying the lung tissue
EvaVertes_2005_68 we need to repair the lung and cancer is originating in the lung trying to repair because you have this excessive proliferation
EvaVertes_2005_69 of these remarkable cells that really have the potential to become lung tissue 
EvaVertes_2005_70 but it's almost as if the body has originated this ingenious response but can't quite control it it hasn't yet become fine tuned enough to finish what has been initiated 
EvaVertes_2005_71 so this really really fascinated me
EvaVertes_2005_72 really think that we can't think about cancer let alone any disease in such black and white terms
EvaVertes_2005_73 if we eliminate cancer the way we're trying to do now with chemotherapy and radiation we're bombarding the body or the cancer with toxins or with radiation trying to kill it it's almost as if we're getting back to this starting point
EvaVertes_2005_74 we're removing the cancer cells but we're revealing the the previous damage that
EvaVertes_2005_75 the body has tried to fix shouldn't we think about manipulation rather than elimination if somehow we can
EvaVertes_2005_76 cause these cells to differentiate to become bone tissue lung tissue liver tissue whatever that cancer has been put there to do
EvaVertes_2005_77 it would it would be a repair process
EvaVertes_2005_78 really changed my view of looking at cancer 
EvaVertes_2005_79 and while i was reading all these articles about cancer 
EvaVertes_2005_80 it seemed that the articles a lot of them focused on you know the genetics of breast cancer and the genesis and the progression of breast cancer
EvaVertes_2005_81 tracking the cancer through the body tracing where
EvaVertes_2005_82 it struck me that i'd never heard of
EvaVertes_2005_83 cancer of the heart or cancer of any skeletal muscle for that matter
EvaVertes_2005_84 and skeletal muscle constitutes fifty percent of our body or over fifty percent of our body 
EvaVertes_2005_85 and so
EvaVertes_2005_86 at first i kind of thought well maybe there's some obvious explanation why skeletal muscle doesn't get cancer at least not that i know of
EvaVertes_2005_87 i looked further into it found as many articles as i could and it was amazing because
EvaVertes_2005_88 it turned out that it was very rare some articles
EvaVertes_2005_89 even went as far as to say that skeletal muscle tissue is resistant to cancer and furthermore not only to cancer but of 
EvaVertes_2005_90 going to skeletal muscle and what metastases are is when the tumor when a piece breaks off and travels through the blood stream and goes to a different organ
EvaVertes_2005_91 that's what a metastasis is it's the part of cancer that is the most dangerous if cancer was localized
EvaVertes_2005_92 we could likely remove it or somehow
EvaVertes_2005_93 you know it's contained it's very contained but once it starts moving throughout the body that's when it becomes deadly so the fact that not not only did cancer not seem to originate in skeletal
EvaVertes_2005_94 but cancer didn't seem to go to skeletal muscle there seemed to be something here so these articles were saying you know skeletal
EvaVertes_2005_95 metastasis to skeletal muscle is very rare but it was left at that no one seemed to be asking why so
EvaVertes_2005_96 i decided to ask why at first the first thing i did was i emailed some professors who specialized in skeletal muscle
EvaVertes_2005_97 cancer doesn't really go to skeletal muscle is there a reason for this and a lot of the replies i got were that
EvaVertes_2005_98 muscle is terminally differentiated tissue meaning that
EvaVertes_2005_99 you have muscle cells but they're not dividing so it doesn't seem like a good target for cancer to hijack but then again this fact that the 
EvaVertes_2005_100 go to skeletal muscle
EvaVertes_2005_101 made that seem unlikely and furthermore that nervous nervous tissue brain gets
EvaVertes_2005_102 cancer and brain cells are also terminally differentiated so i decided to ask why and
EvaVertes_2005_103 here's some of i guess my hypotheses that i'll be starting to investigate this this may at the sylvester cancer
EvaVertes_2005_104 institute in miami and
EvaVertes_2005_105 i guess i'll keep investigating until
EvaVertes_2005_106 i get the answers but i know that in science once you get the answers 
EvaVertes_2005_107 inevitably you're going to have more questions so i guess you could say that i'll probably be doing this for the rest of my life
EvaVertes_2005_108 some of my hypotheses are that when you first think about skeletal muscle
EvaVertes_2005_109 there's a lot of blood vessels going to skeletal muscle and the first thing that makes me think is that
EvaVertes_2005_110 blood vessels are like highways for the tumor cells 
EvaVertes_2005_111 tumor cells can travel through the blood vessels and you think the more highways there are in a tissue the more likely it is to get cancer or to get metastases
EvaVertes_2005_112 so first of all i thought you know wouldn't it be favorable to cancer getting to skeletal muscle and as well cancer
EvaVertes_2005_113 tumors require a process called angiogenesis which is really
EvaVertes_2005_114 really the tumor recruits the blood vessels to itself to supply itself with nutrients so it can grow
EvaVertes_2005_115 without angiogenesis the tumor remains the size
EvaVertes_2005_116 of a pinpoint
EvaVertes_2005_117 and it's not harmful so angiogenesis is really a central process to the pathogenesis of cancer 
EvaVertes_2005_118 and one article that really
EvaVertes_2005_119 stood out to me when i was just reading about this trying to figure out why
EvaVertes_2005_120 cancer doesn't go to skeletal muscle was that it had reported sixteen percent of
EvaVertes_2005_121 to skeletal muscle upon autopsy sixteen percent meaning that there there were these pinpoint tumors in skeletal muscle
EvaVertes_2005_122 the angiogenesis is able to control the tumors
EvaVertes_2005_123 recruiting these blood vessels
EvaVertes_2005_124 we use skeletal muscles so much it's the one portion of our body our heart's always beating we're always moving our muscles
EvaVertes_2005_125 is it possible that
EvaVertes_2005_126 muscle somehow intuitively knows that it needs this blood supply
EvaVertes_2005_127 it needs to be constantly contracting so therefore it's almost selfish it's grabbing its blood vessels for itself therefore when a tumor comes into skeletal muscle tissue 
EvaVertes_2005_128 it can't get a blood supply and can't grow so this suggests that maybe if there
EvaVertes_2005_129 factor in skeletal muscle or perhaps even more an angiogenic routing factor so it can actually direct where the blood vessels grow
EvaVertes_2005_130 this could be a potential future therapy for cancer and
EvaVertes_2005_131 another thing that's really interesting is that
EvaVertes_2005_132 there's this whole the way
EvaVertes_2005_133 tumors move throughout the body it's a very complex system and there's something called the chemokine network
EvaVertes_2005_134 and chemokines are essentially chemical attractants and they're the stop and go signals for cancer 
EvaVertes_2005_135 so a tumor a tumor expresses chemokine receptors and another organ a distant organ
EvaVertes_2005_136 somewhere in the body
EvaVertes_2005_137 will have the corresponding chemokines and the tumor will see these chemokines and migrate towards it
EvaVertes_2005_138 is it possible that skeletal muscle doesn't express this type of molecules
EvaVertes_2005_139 and the other really interesting thing is that
EvaVertes_2005_140 when skeletal muscle there's been several reports that when skeletal muscle is
EvaVertes_2005_141 that's what correlates with metastases going to skeletal muscle 
EvaVertes_2005_142 and furthermore when skeletal muscle is injured that's what causes chemokines these signals saying cancer you can come to me the go signs for the tumors
EvaVertes_2005_143 it causes them to highly express these chemokines so there's so much interplay here
EvaVertes_2005_144 for why tumors don't go to skeletal muscle but it seems like
EvaVertes_2005_145 by investigating by attacking cancer by searching where cancer is not there has got to be something there's got to be something that's
EvaVertes_2005_146 making this tissue resistant to tumors and can we utilize can we take this
EvaVertes_2005_147 and apply it to
EvaVertes_2005_148 cancer therapy in general now one thing that kind of ties the
EvaVertes_2005_149 resistance of skeletal muscle to cancer to the cancer as a repair response gone out of control in the body
EvaVertes_2005_150 is that skeletal muscle has a factor in it called
EvaVertes_2005_151 and what myod essentially does
EvaVertes_2005_152 is it causes cells to differentiate into muscle cells 
EvaVertes_2005_153 so this this compound myod has been tested on a lot of different cell types
EvaVertes_2005_154 and been shown to actually convert this variety of cell types into skeletal muscle cells
EvaVertes_2005_155 is it possible that the tumor cells
EvaVertes_2005_156 are going to the skeletal muscle tissue but once
EvaVertes_2005_157 in contact inside the skeletal muscle tissue myod acts upon these tumor cells and causes them to become
EvaVertes_2005_158 skeletal muscle cells maybe tumor cells are being disguised as skeletal muscle cells and this is why
EvaVertes_2005_159 it seems as if it is so
EvaVertes_2005_160 it's not harmful it has just repaired the muscle muscle is constantly being used constantly being damaged 
EvaVertes_2005_161 if every time we tore a muscle or every time we stretched a muscle or moved in a wrong way
EvaVertes_2005_162 cancer occurred
EvaVertes_2005_163 i mean everybody would have cancer almost and i hate to say that but it it seems as though
EvaVertes_2005_164 muscle cell possibly because of all its use has adapted faster than other body tissues to respond to
EvaVertes_2005_165 injury to fine tune this repair response and actually be able to finish the process
EvaVertes_2005_166 which the body wants to finish i really believe that the human body is very very smart and we can't
EvaVertes_2005_167 counteract something the body is saying to do it's different when a bacteria comes into the
EvaVertes_2005_168 a foreign object we want that out but when the body is actually initiating a process and we're calling it a disease it doesn't seem as though elimination is the right solution
EvaVertes_2005_169 so even
EvaVertes_2005_170 to go to go from there it's
EvaVertes_2005_171 possible although far fetched that in the future we could almost think of
EvaVertes_2005_172 cancer being used as a therapy if those diseases where tissues are deteriorating for example alzheimer's
EvaVertes_2005_173 the brain the brain cells die and we need to restore new brain cells new functional brain cells what if we could
EvaVertes_2005_174 in the future use cancer a tumor put it in the brain and cause it to differentiate
EvaVertes_2005_175 into brain cells
EvaVertes_2005_176 that's a very far fetched idea but i really believe that it may be possible these cells are so versatile these cancer
EvaVertes_2005_177 cells are so versatile we just have to manipulate them in the right way and again some of these may be far fetched but
EvaVertes_2005_178 i figured if there's anywhere to present far fetched ideas it's here at ted so
EvaVertes_2005_179 thank you very much
