EvaVertes_2005_1 tell you a bit about the past
EvaVertes_2005_2 my story starts way before i was born my grandmother was on a train to auschwitz the death death camp and
EvaVertes_2005_3 she was going along the tracks and the
EvaVertes_2005_4 the tracks split and somehow we don't really know exactly the whole story but the train took the wrong track and went to a
EvaVertes_2005_7 and
EvaVertes_2005_12 and at forty four she died of stomach cancer
EvaVertes_2005_18 i had never been a reader when i was young my dad had tried me with the hardy boys i tried nancy drew i tried all that and i just didn't like reading books 
EvaVertes_2005_22 i read that book and from
EvaVertes_2005_24 i wanted to be like the explorers i'd read about in the book who
EvaVertes_2005_25 went into the jungles of africa went into the research labs and just tried to figure out what this deadly virus was
EvaVertes_2005_27 and i just loved it so much i was a passive observer observer of the medical world it wasn't until i entered high
EvaVertes_2005_31 and i got to go talk to one professor dr jacobs who accepted me into the lab
EvaVertes_2005_33 the effects of heavy metals on the developing nervous system so
EvaVertes_2005_34 i started that and
EvaVertes_2005_37 spinal cord had breaks the neurons were crossing
EvaVertes_2005_40 i started reading about alzheimer's and tried to familiarize myself with the research
EvaVertes_2005_43 properties and being naive about the whole field i kind of thought oh you have cell death in alzheimer's which is causing the memory deficit and then you have
EvaVertes_2005_46 pursued for that year and it's continuing now as well and found that
EvaVertes_2005_51 and
EvaVertes_2005_54 and i stumbled across something called cancer stem cells and this is really what i want to talk to you about today about cancer
EvaVertes_2005_61 the more i read the more i looked at cancer differently and almost became less fearful of it
EvaVertes_2005_63 lung cancer arises if you drink you damage your liver and then liver cancer occurs
EvaVertes_2005_65 these phenomenal cells
EvaVertes_2005_66 that really have the ability to differentiate into any type of tissue so if the body is sensing that you have damage to an organ
EvaVertes_2005_67 and then it's initiating cancer it's almost as if this is a repair response and the cancer the body is saying the lung tissue
EvaVertes_2005_68 we need to repair the lung and cancer is originating in the lung trying to repair because you have this excessive proliferation
EvaVertes_2005_72 really think that we can't think about cancer let alone any disease in such black and white terms
EvaVertes_2005_76 cause these cells to differentiate to become bone tissue lung tissue liver tissue whatever that cancer has been put there to do
EvaVertes_2005_78 really changed my view of looking at cancer 
EvaVertes_2005_80 it seemed that the articles a lot of them focused on you know the genetics of breast cancer and the genesis and the progression of breast cancer
EvaVertes_2005_81 tracking the cancer through the body tracing where
EvaVertes_2005_83 cancer of the heart or cancer of any skeletal muscle for that matter
EvaVertes_2005_84 and skeletal muscle constitutes fifty percent of our body or over fifty percent of our body 
EvaVertes_2005_86 at first i kind of thought well maybe there's some obvious explanation why skeletal muscle doesn't get cancer at least not that i know of
EvaVertes_2005_87 i looked further into it found as many articles as i could and it was amazing because
EvaVertes_2005_91 that's what a metastasis is it's the part of cancer that is the most dangerous if cancer was localized
EvaVertes_2005_92 we could likely remove it or somehow
EvaVertes_2005_96 i decided to ask why at first the first thing i did was i emailed some professors who specialized in skeletal muscle
EvaVertes_2005_98 muscle is terminally differentiated tissue meaning that
EvaVertes_2005_103 here's some of i guess my hypotheses that i'll be starting to investigate this this may at the sylvester cancer
EvaVertes_2005_104 institute in miami and
EvaVertes_2005_105 i guess i'll keep investigating until
EvaVertes_2005_108 some of my hypotheses are that when you first think about skeletal muscle
EvaVertes_2005_109 there's a lot of blood vessels going to skeletal muscle and the first thing that makes me think is that
EvaVertes_2005_110 blood vessels are like highways for the tumor cells 
EvaVertes_2005_113 tumors require a process called angiogenesis which is really
EvaVertes_2005_114 really the tumor recruits the blood vessels to itself to supply itself with nutrients so it can grow
EvaVertes_2005_115 without angiogenesis the tumor remains the size
EvaVertes_2005_116 of a pinpoint
EvaVertes_2005_117 and it's not harmful so angiogenesis is really a central process to the pathogenesis of cancer 
EvaVertes_2005_121 to skeletal muscle upon autopsy sixteen percent meaning that there there were these pinpoint tumors in skeletal muscle
EvaVertes_2005_125 is it possible that
EvaVertes_2005_126 muscle somehow intuitively knows that it needs this blood supply
EvaVertes_2005_128 it can't get a blood supply and can't grow so this suggests that maybe if there
EvaVertes_2005_130 this could be a potential future therapy for cancer and
EvaVertes_2005_131 another thing that's really interesting is that
EvaVertes_2005_133 tumors move throughout the body it's a very complex system and there's something called the chemokine network
EvaVertes_2005_135 so a tumor a tumor expresses chemokine receptors and another organ a distant organ
EvaVertes_2005_137 will have the corresponding chemokines and the tumor will see these chemokines and migrate towards it
EvaVertes_2005_145 by investigating by attacking cancer by searching where cancer is not there has got to be something there's got to be something that's
EvaVertes_2005_146 making this tissue resistant to tumors and can we utilize can we take this
EvaVertes_2005_151 and what myod essentially does
EvaVertes_2005_152 is it causes cells to differentiate into muscle cells 
EvaVertes_2005_157 in contact inside the skeletal muscle tissue myod acts upon these tumor cells and causes them to become
EvaVertes_2005_160 it's not harmful it has just repaired the muscle muscle is constantly being used constantly being damaged 
EvaVertes_2005_161 if every time we tore a muscle or every time we stretched a muscle or moved in a wrong way
EvaVertes_2005_167 counteract something the body is saying to do it's different when a bacteria comes into the
EvaVertes_2005_170 to go to go from there it's
EvaVertes_2005_173 the brain the brain cells die and we need to restore new brain cells new functional brain cells what if we could
EvaVertes_2005_175 into brain cells
EvaVertes_2005_177 cells are so versatile we just have to manipulate them in the right way and again some of these may be far fetched but
EvaVertes_2005_179 thank you very much
