EvaVertes_2005_5 work camp rather than the death camp
EvaVertes_2005_8 married my grandfather they were living in hungary and my mother was born and when my mother was two years old the hungarian revolution
EvaVertes_2005_9 was raging and they decided to escape hungary 
EvaVertes_2005_11 to make a long story short they came to canada my grandmother was a chemist she worked at the banting institute in toronto
EvaVertes_2005_23 when i was reading that book i knew that i wanted to have a life
EvaVertes_2005_29 i was fourteen and i emailed professors at the
EvaVertes_2005_30 local university to see if maybe i could go work in their lab and hardly anyone responded but i mean why would they respond to a 14 year old anyway 
EvaVertes_2005_41 and at the same time when i was in the i was reading in the medical library one day and i read this article about something called
EvaVertes_2005_45 the project that i
EvaVertes_2005_48 those results at the international science fair which was just one of the most amazing experiences of my life and there i was
EvaVertes_2005_52 from then on since i was now in this huge exciting world 
EvaVertes_2005_58 last summer i worked at stanford university doing some research on cancer stem cells and while i was doing
EvaVertes_2005_60 that tumors actually begin from a stem cell this fascinated me 
EvaVertes_2005_64 and it was really interesting there were articles correlating if you have a bone fracture and then bone cancer arises
EvaVertes_2005_70 but it's almost as if the body has originated this ingenious response but can't quite control it it hasn't yet become fine tuned enough to finish what has been initiated 
EvaVertes_2005_74 we're removing the cancer cells but we're revealing the the previous damage that
EvaVertes_2005_82 it struck me that i'd never heard of
EvaVertes_2005_88 it turned out that it was very rare some articles
EvaVertes_2005_90 going to skeletal muscle and what metastases are is when the tumor when a piece breaks off and travels through the blood stream and goes to a different organ
EvaVertes_2005_95 metastasis to skeletal muscle is very rare but it was left at that no one seemed to be asking why so
EvaVertes_2005_101 made that seem unlikely and furthermore that nervous nervous tissue brain gets
EvaVertes_2005_106 i get the answers but i know that in science once you get the answers 
EvaVertes_2005_120 cancer doesn't go to skeletal muscle was that it had reported sixteen percent of
EvaVertes_2005_132 there's this whole the way
EvaVertes_2005_138 is it possible that skeletal muscle doesn't express this type of molecules
EvaVertes_2005_139 and the other really interesting thing is that
EvaVertes_2005_140 when skeletal muscle there's been several reports that when skeletal muscle is
EvaVertes_2005_141 that's what correlates with metastases going to skeletal muscle 
EvaVertes_2005_142 and furthermore when skeletal muscle is injured that's what causes chemokines these signals saying cancer you can come to me the go signs for the tumors
EvaVertes_2005_144 for why tumors don't go to skeletal muscle but it seems like
EvaVertes_2005_150 is that skeletal muscle has a factor in it called
EvaVertes_2005_158 skeletal muscle cells maybe tumor cells are being disguised as skeletal muscle cells and this is why
EvaVertes_2005_159 it seems as if it is so
EvaVertes_2005_165 injury to fine tune this repair response and actually be able to finish the process
EvaVertes_2005_168 a foreign object we want that out but when the body is actually initiating a process and we're calling it a disease it doesn't seem as though elimination is the right solution
EvaVertes_2005_176 that's a very far fetched idea but i really believe that it may be possible these cells are so versatile these cancer
