EvaVertes_2005_0 a privilege to be here spending my last day as a teenager today i want to talk to you about the future but first i
EvaVertes_2005_6 my grandmother survived
EvaVertes_2005_10 they got on a boat and yet another divergence the boat was either going to canada or to australia they got on and didn't know where they were going and ended up in
EvaVertes_2005_13 i never met my grandmother but i carry on her name
EvaVertes_2005_14 her exact name eva vertes
EvaVertes_2005_15 and i like to think i carry on her scientific passion too i found this passion not far from here actually when i was nine years old
EvaVertes_2005_16 my family was on a road trip and
EvaVertes_2005_17 we were in the grand canyon and
EvaVertes_2005_19 and my mother bought this book when we were at the grand canyon called the hot zone it was all about
EvaVertes_2005_20 the outbreak of the ebola virus and something about it just kind of drew me towards it there was this big sort of bumpy looking virus on the cover and
EvaVertes_2005_21 i just wanted to read it i picked up that book and as we drove from the edge of the grand canyon to big sur and to actually here where we are today in monterey 
EvaVertes_2005_26 so from that moment on i read every medical book i could get my hands on
EvaVertes_2005_28 maybe now you know being a big high school kid i can maybe become an active part of this big medical world 
EvaVertes_2005_32 at that time i was really interested in neuroscience and wanted to do a research project in neurology specifically looking at
EvaVertes_2005_35 worked in his lab for a year and
EvaVertes_2005_36 found the results that i guess you'd expect to find when you feed fruit flies heavy metals that it really really impaired the nervous system
EvaVertes_2005_38 in every which way and from then i wanted to look not at impairment but at prevention of impairment
EvaVertes_2005_39 so that's what led me to alzheimer's
EvaVertes_2005_42 and they seemed to have cell 
EvaVertes_2005_44 this compound purine derivatives that are promoting cell growth and so i thought maybe if it can promote cell
EvaVertes_2005_47 a specific purine derivative called guanidine had inhibited the cell growth by approximately sixty percent so i presented
EvaVertes_2005_49 best in the world in medicine which
EvaVertes_2005_50 allowed me to get in or at least get get a foot in the door of the big medical world
EvaVertes_2005_53 i wanted to explore it all i wanted it all at once but knew i couldn't really get that
EvaVertes_2005_55 at first when i heard of cancer stem cells
EvaVertes_2005_56 i didn't really know how to put the two together i'd heard of stem cells and i'd heard of them as the panacea of the future the therapy of many diseases to come in the future perhaps
EvaVertes_2005_57 but i'd heard of cancer as the most feared disease of our time so how did the good and bad go together
EvaVertes_2005_59 this i was reading the cancer literature trying to again familiarize myself with this new medical field and it seemed that
EvaVertes_2005_62 it seems that cancer is a direct result to injury if you smoke you damage your lung tissue and then
EvaVertes_2005_69 of these remarkable cells that really have the potential to become lung tissue 
EvaVertes_2005_71 so this really really fascinated me
EvaVertes_2005_73 if we eliminate cancer the way we're trying to do now with chemotherapy and radiation we're bombarding the body or the cancer with toxins or with radiation trying to kill it it's almost as if we're getting back to this starting point
EvaVertes_2005_75 the body has tried to fix shouldn't we think about manipulation rather than elimination if somehow we can
EvaVertes_2005_77 it would it would be a repair process
EvaVertes_2005_79 and while i was reading all these articles about cancer 
EvaVertes_2005_85 and so
EvaVertes_2005_89 even went as far as to say that skeletal muscle tissue is resistant to cancer and furthermore not only to cancer but of 
EvaVertes_2005_93 you know it's contained it's very contained but once it starts moving throughout the body that's when it becomes deadly so the fact that not not only did cancer not seem to originate in skeletal
EvaVertes_2005_94 but cancer didn't seem to go to skeletal muscle there seemed to be something here so these articles were saying you know skeletal
EvaVertes_2005_97 cancer doesn't really go to skeletal muscle is there a reason for this and a lot of the replies i got were that
EvaVertes_2005_99 you have muscle cells but they're not dividing so it doesn't seem like a good target for cancer to hijack but then again this fact that the 
EvaVertes_2005_100 go to skeletal muscle
EvaVertes_2005_102 cancer and brain cells are also terminally differentiated so i decided to ask why and
EvaVertes_2005_107 inevitably you're going to have more questions so i guess you could say that i'll probably be doing this for the rest of my life
EvaVertes_2005_111 tumor cells can travel through the blood vessels and you think the more highways there are in a tissue the more likely it is to get cancer or to get metastases
EvaVertes_2005_112 so first of all i thought you know wouldn't it be favorable to cancer getting to skeletal muscle and as well cancer
EvaVertes_2005_118 and one article that really
EvaVertes_2005_119 stood out to me when i was just reading about this trying to figure out why
EvaVertes_2005_122 the angiogenesis is able to control the tumors
EvaVertes_2005_123 recruiting these blood vessels
EvaVertes_2005_124 we use skeletal muscles so much it's the one portion of our body our heart's always beating we're always moving our muscles
EvaVertes_2005_127 it needs to be constantly contracting so therefore it's almost selfish it's grabbing its blood vessels for itself therefore when a tumor comes into skeletal muscle tissue 
EvaVertes_2005_129 factor in skeletal muscle or perhaps even more an angiogenic routing factor so it can actually direct where the blood vessels grow
EvaVertes_2005_134 and chemokines are essentially chemical attractants and they're the stop and go signals for cancer 
EvaVertes_2005_136 somewhere in the body
EvaVertes_2005_143 it causes them to highly express these chemokines so there's so much interplay here
EvaVertes_2005_147 and apply it to
EvaVertes_2005_148 cancer therapy in general now one thing that kind of ties the
EvaVertes_2005_149 resistance of skeletal muscle to cancer to the cancer as a repair response gone out of control in the body
EvaVertes_2005_153 so this this compound myod has been tested on a lot of different cell types
EvaVertes_2005_154 and been shown to actually convert this variety of cell types into skeletal muscle cells
EvaVertes_2005_155 is it possible that the tumor cells
EvaVertes_2005_156 are going to the skeletal muscle tissue but once
EvaVertes_2005_162 cancer occurred
EvaVertes_2005_163 i mean everybody would have cancer almost and i hate to say that but it it seems as though
EvaVertes_2005_164 muscle cell possibly because of all its use has adapted faster than other body tissues to respond to
EvaVertes_2005_166 which the body wants to finish i really believe that the human body is very very smart and we can't
EvaVertes_2005_169 so even
EvaVertes_2005_171 possible although far fetched that in the future we could almost think of
EvaVertes_2005_172 cancer being used as a therapy if those diseases where tissues are deteriorating for example alzheimer's
EvaVertes_2005_174 in the future use cancer a tumor put it in the brain and cause it to differentiate
EvaVertes_2005_178 i figured if there's anywhere to present far fetched ideas it's here at ted so
