GeorgePapandreou_2013G_2 and in our globalizing economy and i won't provide some
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_3 solutions but i will in the end urge you
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_5 of democracy failure of leadership what is the failure of leadership today
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_6 and why is our democracy not working well i believe that the failure of leadership is the fact that we have taken
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_13 political innovation
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_14 which protected this freedom because we were liberated from fear
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_15 so that our minds in fact whether they be despots or dogmas could be the protagonists
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_19 i used to to try to avoid homework
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_20 sneak down to the living room and listen to my parents and their friends debate heatedly you see then greece was
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_21 under control of a very powerful
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_22 establishment which was strangling the country and my father was heading a promising movement to reimagine greece to
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_24 i used to join him in many of the campaigns and you can see me here next to him i'm the younger one there to the side
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_29 military trucks drive up to our house
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_34 which we spent in exile now
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_36 april two thousand and ten i'm sitting with my counterparts in the european union i had just been elected prime minister 
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_38 that our deficit was not six percent as had been officially reported only a few days earlier before the elections
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_40 but the deficit was only
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_41 the symptom of much deeper problems that greece was facing and
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_43 lack of transparency and accountability in governance or whether it was a clientelistic state offering favors to
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_46 politics and media captured by special interests 
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_50 for a united european response one that would calm the markets and give us the time
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_51 to make the necessary reforms but time we didn't get
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_55 no we have to have an agreement now
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_57 we quickly came to a decision in those ten minutes this time it was not the military but
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_60 painful to my countrymen imposing cuts austerity often on those not to blame for the crisis
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_63 but i think today that most would agree
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_67 trapped by systems too big to fail or more accurately too big to control
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_70 by the growing inequality and the growing concentration of power and wealth
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_72 we sometimes fear an impending disaster have constrained our democracies and they have constrained our capacity to imagine and actually use the potential your potential
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_73 in finding solutions
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_74 a preview of what is in store for us all i overly optimistically had hoped that this crisis
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_76 instead i had a very humbling experience
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_77 in brussels when we tried desperately again and again
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_79 had ever dealt with a similar crisis but worse we were trapped by our collective ignorance we were led
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_83 societies investing in it to find more creative solutions we reverted to political posturing 
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_86 to look for a whipping boy for our collective european failure and of course
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_87 a convenient but unfounded stereotype that sometimes hurt
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_89 that leaders follow again and again when we deal with these complex
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_90 problems whether it's climate change whether it's migration whether it's the financial system
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_93 and doing so will only test the faith of our citizens of our peoples even more in the democratic process
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_95 have lost the trust
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_97 increasingly common around the world then there's something deeply wrong with our democracies
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_102 since leaving office i have had time to reflect 
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_103 we have weathered the storm in greece and in europe 
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_104 but we remain challenged
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_107 far we've thrown economics at the problem actually mostly austerity 
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_108 and certainly we could have designed alternatives a different strategy a green stimulus for green jobs or
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_111 of democracy so let's try something else let's see how we can bring people back to the process let's throw democracy at the problem
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_114 work without the citizens
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_115 deliberating debating taking on public responsibilities for public affairs 
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_116 average citizens often were chosen for citizen juries to
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_118 science theater research philosophy games of the mind and the body they were daily exercises actually they were an education for
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_121 idiot comes from the root idio oneself a
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_129 to local politics while our citizens even though they see a great potential are prey
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_138 let's see if we can't design a european agora not simply for products and services but for our citizens where they can
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_142 or citizen juries
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_143 chosen by lottery which can deliberate on critical and controversial issues
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_151 democracy where our education is
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_153 and solidarity rather than exclusion and xenophobia europe of and by the people a europe
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_154 an experiment in deepening and widening democracy
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_156 now some might accuse me of being naive putting my faith in the power and the wisdom of the people 
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_158 believe me i have been i am part of today's political system 
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_160 must revive politics as the power to imagine reimagine and redesign
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_161 for a better world 
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_164 and i mean all of you everyone who participates in this global exchange of ideas whether it's here in this room or just outside this room
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_168 everyone who stands up to the unchecked power whether it's authoritarian leaders plutocrats hiding their assets in tax havens
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_169 or powerful lobbies protecting the powerful few
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_175 papandreou well obviously there were constraints which didn't allow
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_178 we have kept the potential the huge potential of our society out of this process and
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_179 we are closing in on ourselves in politics and i think we need to to change that to really find new participatory ways
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_182 more closed borders and less cooperation and maybe even stepping out of some of the different parts of the european construction 
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_183 i think one of the worst things that happened during this crisis is that we started a blame game and
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_184 the fundamental idea of europe is that we can cooperate beyond borders go beyond our conflicts and work together and
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_185 the the
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_187 while now is the time when we really need to bring our powers together
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_188 more europe for me is not simply
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_189 giving more power to brussels it is actually giving more power to the citizens of europe that is
