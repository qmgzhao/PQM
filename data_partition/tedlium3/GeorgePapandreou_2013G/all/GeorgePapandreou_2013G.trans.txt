GeorgePapandreou_2013G_0 this will not be a speech like any one i have ever given i will talk to you today about
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_1 the failure of leadership in global politics
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_2 and in our globalizing economy and i won't provide some
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_3 solutions but i will in the end urge you
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_4 to rethink actually take risks and get involved in what i see as a global evolution
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_5 of democracy failure of leadership what is the failure of leadership today
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_6 and why is our democracy not working well i believe that the failure of leadership is the fact that we have taken
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_7 you out of the process so let me from my personal experiences give you
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_8 an insight so that you can step back and maybe understand why it is so difficult to cope with the challenges of today and why politics is going
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_9 a blind alley let's start from the beginning let's start from
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_10 democracy well if you go back to the ancient greeks it was a revelation a discovery that
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_11 we had the potential together to be masters of our
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_12 to be able to examine to learn to imagine and then to design a better life and democracy was the
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_13 political innovation
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_14 which protected this freedom because we were liberated from fear
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_15 so that our minds in fact whether they be despots or dogmas could be the protagonists
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_16 democracy was the political innovation that allowed us to limit the power whether it was of tyrants
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_17 or of high priests
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_18 their natural tendency to maximize power and wealth well i first began to understand this when i was fourteen years old
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_19 i used to to try to avoid homework
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_20 sneak down to the living room and listen to my parents and their friends debate heatedly you see then greece was
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_21 under control of a very powerful
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_22 establishment which was strangling the country and my father was heading a promising movement to reimagine greece to
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_23 imagine a greece where freedom reigned and where maybe the people the citizens could actually rule
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_24 i used to join him in many of the campaigns and you can see me here next to him i'm the younger one there to the side
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_25 you may not recognize me because i used to part my hair differently there
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_26 elections were coming
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_27 things were going well in the campaign the house was electric we really could sense that there was going to be a major progressive change in greece
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_28 one night
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_29 military trucks drive up to our house
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_30 soldiers storm the door they find me up on the top terrace a
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_31 sergeant comes up to me with a machine gun puts it to my head and says tell me where your father is or i will kill you
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_32 and was summarily
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_33 taken to prison well we survived but democracy did not seven brutal years of dictatorship
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_34 which we spent in exile now
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_35 today our democracies are again facing a moment of truth let me tell you a story sunday evening
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_36 april two thousand and ten i'm sitting with my counterparts in the european union i had just been elected prime minister 
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_37 but i had the unhappy privilege of revealing a truth
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_38 that our deficit was not six percent as had been officially reported only a few days earlier before the elections
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_39 by the previous government but actually fifteen point six percent
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_40 but the deficit was only
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_41 the symptom of much deeper problems that greece was facing and
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_42 i had been elected on a mandate a mission actually to tackle these problems whether it was
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_43 lack of transparency and accountability in governance or whether it was a clientelistic state offering favors to
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_44 the powerful tax avoidance abetted and aided by a global tax
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_45 evasion system
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_46 politics and media captured by special interests 
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_47 but despite our electoral mandate the markets mistrusted us
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_48 our borrowing costs were skyrocketing and we were facing possible default so i went to brussels on a mission
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_49 to make the case
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_50 for a united european response one that would calm the markets and give us the time
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_51 to make the necessary reforms but time we didn't get
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_52 picture yourselves around the table in brussels 
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_53 negotiations are difficult the tensions are high progress is slow and then ten minutes to two a prime minister shouts out we have to
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_54 these are important decisions let's deliberate a little bit longer another prime minister comes in and says
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_55 no we have to have an agreement now
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_56 because in ten minutes the markets are opening up in japan and there will be havoc in the global economy
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_57 we quickly came to a decision in those ten minutes this time it was not the military but
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_58 the markets that put a gun to our collective heads
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_59 what followed were the most difficult decisions in my life painful to me 
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_60 painful to my countrymen imposing cuts austerity often on those not to blame for the crisis
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_61 with these sacrifices greece did avoid bankruptcy and the eurozone avoided
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_62 a collapse greece yes triggered the euro crisis and some people blame me for pulling the trigger 
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_63 but i think today that most would agree
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_64 that greece was only a symptom
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_65 of much deeper
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_66 structural problems in the eurozone vulnerabilities in the wider global economic system vulnerabilities of our democracies
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_67 trapped by systems too big to fail or more accurately too big to control
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_68 our democracies are weakened in the global economy with players that can evade laws evade taxes evade environmental or labor standards
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_69 our democracies are undermined
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_70 by the growing inequality and the growing concentration of power and wealth
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_71 corruption the speed of the markets or simply the fact that
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_72 we sometimes fear an impending disaster have constrained our democracies and they have constrained our capacity to imagine and actually use the potential your potential
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_73 in finding solutions
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_74 a preview of what is in store for us all i overly optimistically had hoped that this crisis
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_75 was an opportunity for greece for europe for the world to make radical democratic transformations in our institutions 
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_76 instead i had a very humbling experience
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_77 in brussels when we tried desperately again and again
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_78 to find common solutions i realized that not one not one of us
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_79 had ever dealt with a similar crisis but worse we were trapped by our collective ignorance we were led
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_80 by our fears and our fears led to a blind faith
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_81 in the orthodoxy of austerity instead of reaching out to the
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_82 common or the collective wisdom in our
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_83 societies investing in it to find more creative solutions we reverted to political posturing 
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_84 and then we were surprised when every ad hoc new measure
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_85 didn't bring an end to the crisis and of course that made it very easy
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_86 to look for a whipping boy for our collective european failure and of course
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_87 a convenient but unfounded stereotype that sometimes hurt
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_88 even more than austerity itself but let me warn you this is not just about greece this could be the pattern
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_89 that leaders follow again and again when we deal with these complex
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_90 problems whether it's climate change whether it's migration whether it's the financial system
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_91 that is abandoning our collective power to imagine our potential falling victims to our fears our stereotypes our dogmas 
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_92 taking our citizens out of the process rather than building the process around
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_93 and doing so will only test the faith of our citizens of our peoples even more in the democratic process
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_94 it's no wonder that many political leaders and i don't exclude myself
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_95 have lost the trust
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_96 of our people when riot police have to protect parliaments a scene which is
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_97 increasingly common around the world then there's something deeply wrong with our democracies
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_98 that's why i called for a referendum to have the greek people own and decide
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_99 on the terms of the rescue package my european counterparts some of them at least said you can't do this there will be
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_100 havoc in the markets again i said we need to before we restore confidence in the markets we need to restore
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_101 confidence and trust amongst our people
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_102 since leaving office i have had time to reflect 
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_103 we have weathered the storm in greece and in europe 
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_104 but we remain challenged
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_105 if politics is the power to imagine and use our potential well then 60 percent youth unemployment in greece
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_106 and in other countries certainly is a lack of imagination if not a lack of compassion
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_107 far we've thrown economics at the problem actually mostly austerity 
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_108 and certainly we could have designed alternatives a different strategy a green stimulus for green jobs or
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_109 mutualized debt eurobonds which would support countries in need from
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_110 market pressures these would have been much more viable alternatives yet i have come to believe that the problem is not so much one of economics as it is one
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_111 of democracy so let's try something else let's see how we can bring people back to the process let's throw democracy at the problem
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_112 again the ancient greeks with all their shortcomings believed in the wisdom of the crowd
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_113 at their best moments in people we trust democracy could not
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_114 work without the citizens
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_115 deliberating debating taking on public responsibilities for public affairs 
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_116 average citizens often were chosen for citizen juries to
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_117 decide on critical matters of the day 
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_118 science theater research philosophy games of the mind and the body they were daily exercises actually they were an education for
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_119 for the potential for growing the potential of our citizens and those who shunned politics well they were
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_120 idiots you see in ancient greece in ancient athens that term originated there
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_121 idiot comes from the root idio oneself a
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_122 person who is self centered secluded excluded someone who doesn't participate or even examine
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_123 and participation took place in the agora the agora having two meanings both a marketplace
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_124 and a place where there was political deliberation
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_125 you see markets and politics then were one unified accessible transparent because they gave power to the people they serve the demos 
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_126 democracy 
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_127 above markets was the direct rule of the people today we have globalized the markets
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_128 but we have not globalized our democratic institutions so our politicians are limited
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_129 to local politics while our citizens even though they see a great potential are prey
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_130 to forces beyond their control so how then do we reunite the two halves of the agora how do we democratize globalization
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_131 and i'm not talking about the necessary reforms of the united nations or the g20 i'm talking about how do we secure the space the demos the platform of values
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_132 so that we can tap into
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_133 all of your potential well
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_134 this is exactly where i think europe fits in europe despite its recent failures is the world's most successful
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_135 cross border peace experiment so let's see if it can't be
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_136 an experiment
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_137 in global democracy a new kind of democracy 
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_138 let's see if we can't design a european agora not simply for products and services but for our citizens where they can
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_139 work together deliberate learn from each other exchange between art and cultures where they can
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_140 come up
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_141 with creative solutions let's imagine that european citizens actually have the power to vote directly for a european president
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_142 or citizen juries
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_143 chosen by lottery which can deliberate on critical and controversial issues
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_144 a european wide referendum where our citizens as the lawmakers vote on future treaties
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_145 and here's an idea
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_146 why not have the first truly european citizens by giving our immigrants not greek or german or
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_147 swedish citizenship but
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_148 a european citizenship and make sure we
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_149 actually empower the unemployed by giving them a voucher scholarship where they can choose to study anywhere in europe where our
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_150 common identity is
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_151 democracy where our education is
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_152 through participation and where participation builds trust
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_153 and solidarity rather than exclusion and xenophobia europe of and by the people a europe
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_154 an experiment in deepening and widening democracy
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_155 beyond borders
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_156 now some might accuse me of being naive putting my faith in the power and the wisdom of the people 
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_157 well after decades in politics i am also a pragmatist
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_158 believe me i have been i am part of today's political system 
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_159 and i know things must change we
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_160 must revive politics as the power to imagine reimagine and redesign
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_161 for a better world 
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_162 but i also know that this disruptive force of change won't be driven by the politics of today the revival of democratic politics
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_163 will come from
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_164 and i mean all of you everyone who participates in this global exchange of ideas whether it's here in this room or just outside this room
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_165 or online or locally where everybody lives everyone who stands up to injustice and inequality
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_166 everybody who stands up to those who preach racism rather than empathy 
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_167 dogma rather than critical thinking technocracy rather than
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_168 everyone who stands up to the unchecked power whether it's authoritarian leaders plutocrats hiding their assets in tax havens
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_169 or powerful lobbies protecting the powerful few
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_170 it is in their interest
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_171 that all of us are idiots let's not be thank you
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_172 you seem to describe a political leadership that is kind of unprepared and a
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_173 prisoner of the whims of the financial markets and that scene in brussels that you describe to me as a citizen is terrifying 
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_174 help us understand how you felt after the decision it was not a good decision clearly but how do you feel after that not as the prime minister but as george
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_175 papandreou well obviously there were constraints which didn't allow
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_176 me or others to make the types of decisions we would have wanted and obviously i had hoped that we would have the time to make the reforms which would have dealt with the deficit rather than trying to cut the deficit which was the symptom of the problem and that hurt that hurt because that first
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_177 the younger generation and not only many of them are demonstrating outside but i think this is one of our problems when we face these crises
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_178 we have kept the potential the huge potential of our society out of this process and
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_179 we are closing in on ourselves in politics and i think we need to to change that to really find new participatory ways
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_180 using the great capabilities that now exist even in technology but not only in technology the minds that we have
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_181 i think we can find solutions which are much better but we have to be open bg you seem to suggest that the way forward is more europe and that is not to be an easy discourse right now in most european countries it's rather the other way
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_182 more closed borders and less cooperation and maybe even stepping out of some of the different parts of the european construction 
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_183 i think one of the worst things that happened during this crisis is that we started a blame game and
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_184 the fundamental idea of europe is that we can cooperate beyond borders go beyond our conflicts and work together and
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_185 the the
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_186 paradox is that because we have this blame game we have less the potential to convince our citizens that we should work together
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_187 while now is the time when we really need to bring our powers together
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_188 more europe for me is not simply
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_189 giving more power to brussels it is actually giving more power to the citizens of europe that is
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_190 really making europe a project of the people so that i think would be a way to answer some of the
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_191 fears that we have in our society bg george thank you for coming to ted
