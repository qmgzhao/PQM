GeorgePapandreou_2013G_1 the failure of leadership in global politics
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_4 to rethink actually take risks and get involved in what i see as a global evolution
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_8 an insight so that you can step back and maybe understand why it is so difficult to cope with the challenges of today and why politics is going
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_9 a blind alley let's start from the beginning let's start from
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_10 democracy well if you go back to the ancient greeks it was a revelation a discovery that
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_11 we had the potential together to be masters of our
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_17 or of high priests
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_18 their natural tendency to maximize power and wealth well i first began to understand this when i was fourteen years old
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_25 you may not recognize me because i used to part my hair differently there
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_26 elections were coming
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_28 one night
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_30 soldiers storm the door they find me up on the top terrace a
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_31 sergeant comes up to me with a machine gun puts it to my head and says tell me where your father is or i will kill you
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_33 taken to prison well we survived but democracy did not seven brutal years of dictatorship
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_37 but i had the unhappy privilege of revealing a truth
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_45 evasion system
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_47 but despite our electoral mandate the markets mistrusted us
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_48 our borrowing costs were skyrocketing and we were facing possible default so i went to brussels on a mission
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_52 picture yourselves around the table in brussels 
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_53 negotiations are difficult the tensions are high progress is slow and then ten minutes to two a prime minister shouts out we have to
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_54 these are important decisions let's deliberate a little bit longer another prime minister comes in and says
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_56 because in ten minutes the markets are opening up in japan and there will be havoc in the global economy
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_58 the markets that put a gun to our collective heads
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_59 what followed were the most difficult decisions in my life painful to me 
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_61 with these sacrifices greece did avoid bankruptcy and the eurozone avoided
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_62 a collapse greece yes triggered the euro crisis and some people blame me for pulling the trigger 
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_64 that greece was only a symptom
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_65 of much deeper
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_66 structural problems in the eurozone vulnerabilities in the wider global economic system vulnerabilities of our democracies
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_68 our democracies are weakened in the global economy with players that can evade laws evade taxes evade environmental or labor standards
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_69 our democracies are undermined
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_75 was an opportunity for greece for europe for the world to make radical democratic transformations in our institutions 
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_78 to find common solutions i realized that not one not one of us
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_84 and then we were surprised when every ad hoc new measure
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_85 didn't bring an end to the crisis and of course that made it very easy
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_88 even more than austerity itself but let me warn you this is not just about greece this could be the pattern
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_91 that is abandoning our collective power to imagine our potential falling victims to our fears our stereotypes our dogmas 
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_92 taking our citizens out of the process rather than building the process around
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_94 it's no wonder that many political leaders and i don't exclude myself
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_96 of our people when riot police have to protect parliaments a scene which is
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_99 on the terms of the rescue package my european counterparts some of them at least said you can't do this there will be
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_100 havoc in the markets again i said we need to before we restore confidence in the markets we need to restore
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_105 if politics is the power to imagine and use our potential well then 60 percent youth unemployment in greece
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_106 and in other countries certainly is a lack of imagination if not a lack of compassion
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_110 market pressures these would have been much more viable alternatives yet i have come to believe that the problem is not so much one of economics as it is one
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_113 at their best moments in people we trust democracy could not
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_117 decide on critical matters of the day 
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_119 for the potential for growing the potential of our citizens and those who shunned politics well they were
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_122 person who is self centered secluded excluded someone who doesn't participate or even examine
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_124 and a place where there was political deliberation
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_126 democracy 
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_130 to forces beyond their control so how then do we reunite the two halves of the agora how do we democratize globalization
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_131 and i'm not talking about the necessary reforms of the united nations or the g20 i'm talking about how do we secure the space the demos the platform of values
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_135 cross border peace experiment so let's see if it can't be
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_137 in global democracy a new kind of democracy 
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_140 come up
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_141 with creative solutions let's imagine that european citizens actually have the power to vote directly for a european president
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_145 and here's an idea
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_146 why not have the first truly european citizens by giving our immigrants not greek or german or
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_147 swedish citizenship but
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_148 a european citizenship and make sure we
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_149 actually empower the unemployed by giving them a voucher scholarship where they can choose to study anywhere in europe where our
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_150 common identity is
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_152 through participation and where participation builds trust
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_157 well after decades in politics i am also a pragmatist
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_159 and i know things must change we
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_162 but i also know that this disruptive force of change won't be driven by the politics of today the revival of democratic politics
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_163 will come from
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_165 or online or locally where everybody lives everyone who stands up to injustice and inequality
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_167 dogma rather than critical thinking technocracy rather than
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_170 it is in their interest
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_173 prisoner of the whims of the financial markets and that scene in brussels that you describe to me as a citizen is terrifying 
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_174 help us understand how you felt after the decision it was not a good decision clearly but how do you feel after that not as the prime minister but as george
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_176 me or others to make the types of decisions we would have wanted and obviously i had hoped that we would have the time to make the reforms which would have dealt with the deficit rather than trying to cut the deficit which was the symptom of the problem and that hurt that hurt because that first
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_180 using the great capabilities that now exist even in technology but not only in technology the minds that we have
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_181 i think we can find solutions which are much better but we have to be open bg you seem to suggest that the way forward is more europe and that is not to be an easy discourse right now in most european countries it's rather the other way
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_191 fears that we have in our society bg george thank you for coming to ted
