GeorgePapandreou_2013G_0 this will not be a speech like any one i have ever given i will talk to you today about
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_7 you out of the process so let me from my personal experiences give you
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_12 to be able to examine to learn to imagine and then to design a better life and democracy was the

GeorgePapandreou_2013G_23 imagine a greece where freedom reigned and where maybe the people the citizens could actually rule
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_27 things were going well in the campaign the house was electric we really could sense that there was going to be a major progressive change in greece

GeorgePapandreou_2013G_81 in the orthodoxy of austerity instead of reaching out to the
GeorgePapandreou_2013G_82 common or the collective wisdom in our
