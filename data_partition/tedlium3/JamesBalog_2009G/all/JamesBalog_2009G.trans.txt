JamesBalog_2009G_0 most of the time art and science stare at each other across a gulf of mutual incomprehension there is great confusion
JamesBalog_2009G_1 when the two look at each other art of course
JamesBalog_2009G_2 looks at the world through
JamesBalog_2009G_3 the psyche the emotions the unconscious at times and of course the aesthetic science
JamesBalog_2009G_4 tends to look at the world through the rational the quantitative things that can be measured and described but it gives art a terrific context of understanding 
JamesBalog_2009G_5 in the extreme ice survey we're dedicated to bringing those two parts of
JamesBalog_2009G_6 human understanding together to merging the art and science
JamesBalog_2009G_7 to the end of helping us understand nature and humanity's relationship with nature better
JamesBalog_2009G_8 specifically i as a person who's been a professional nature photographer my whole adult life
JamesBalog_2009G_9 am firmly of the belief that photography video film have tremendous powers for helping us understand and shape
JamesBalog_2009G_10 the way we think about nature and about ourselves
JamesBalog_2009G_11 in relationship to nature in this project we're specifically interested of course in ice 
JamesBalog_2009G_12 i'm fascinated by the beauty of it the mutability of it the malleability of it and the fabulous shapes in which it can carve itself these first images are from greenland
JamesBalog_2009G_13 but ice has another meaning ice is the
JamesBalog_2009G_14 canary in the global coal mine
JamesBalog_2009G_15 it's the place where we can see and touch and hear and feel climate change in action
JamesBalog_2009G_16 climate change is a really abstract thing in most of the world whether or not you believe in it is based on your sense of is it raining more or is it raining less is it getting hotter or is it getting colder
JamesBalog_2009G_17 what do the computer models say about this that and the other thing
JamesBalog_2009G_18 all of that strip
JamesBalog_2009G_19 in the world of the arctic and alpine environments where the ice is it's real and it's present the changes are happening they're very visible they're photographable they're measurable
JamesBalog_2009G_20 ninety five percent of the glaciers in the world are retreating or shrinking 
JamesBalog_2009G_21 that's outside antarctica ninety five percent of the glaciers in the world are retreating or shrinking and that's because the precipitation patterns and the temperature patterns are changing 
JamesBalog_2009G_22 there is no significant scientific dispute about that
JamesBalog_2009G_23 's been observed it's measured it's bomb proof information and the great irony and tragedy of our time is that a lot of the general public thinks that science is still arguing about that science is not arguing about that
JamesBalog_2009G_24 in these images we see ice from enormous glaciers ice sheets that are hundreds of thousands of years old breaking up into chunks and chunk by chunk by chunk iceberg by iceberg turning into global sea
JamesBalog_2009G_25 level rise so having seen all of this in the course of a 30 year career 
JamesBalog_2009G_26 i was still a skeptic about climate change until about ten years ago because i thought
JamesBalog_2009G_27 the story of climate change was based on computer models i hadn't realized it was based on concrete measurements
JamesBalog_2009G_28 of what the 
JamesBalog_2009G_29 ancient climates were as recorded in the ice sheets as recorded in deep ocean sediments as recorded in lake sediments tree rings and a lot of other
JamesBalog_2009G_30 ways of measuring temperature when i realized that climate change was real and it was not based on computer models i decided that one day i would i would do a project looking at trying to manifest climate change photographically and that led me to this
JamesBalog_2009G_31 i was working on a national geographic assignment conventional single frame still photography and one crazy day i got the idea that i should
JamesBalog_2009G_32 after that assignment was finished i got the idea that i should shoot
JamesBalog_2009G_33 in time lapse photography that i should station a camera or two at a glacier and let it shoot every fifteen minutes or every hour or whatever
JamesBalog_2009G_34 and watch the progression of the landscape over time well within about three
JamesBalog_2009G_35 incautiously turned that idea of a couple of time lapse cameras into
JamesBalog_2009G_36 cameras and the next six months of my life were the hardest
JamesBalog_2009G_37 time in my career trying to design build and deploy out in the field these twenty five time lapse cameras
JamesBalog_2009G_38 they are powered by the sun
JamesBalog_2009G_39 solar panels power them power goes into a battery there is a custom made computer that tells the
JamesBalog_2009G_40 camera when to fire and these cameras are positioned on rocks on the sides of the glaciers and they look in on the glacier from permanent bedrock positions and they watch the evolution of the landscape
JamesBalog_2009G_41 we just had a number of
JamesBalog_2009G_42 cameras out on the greenland ice sheet we actually drilled holes into the ice way deep down below the thawing level and had some cameras out there for the past month and a half or so actually there's still a camera out there right now in any case
JamesBalog_2009G_43 the cameras shoot roughly every hour some of them shoot every half hour every fifteen minutes every five minutes here's a time lapse of one of the time lapse units being made
JamesBalog_2009G_44 i personally obsessed about every nut bolt and washer in these crazy things i spent half my life at our local hardware store during the months when we built these units originally 
JamesBalog_2009G_45 we're working in most of the major glaciated regions of the northern hemisphere
JamesBalog_2009G_46 our time lapse units are in alaska the rockies greenland and iceland and we have repeat photography positions that is places we just visit on an annual basis in british columbia the alps and bolivia 
JamesBalog_2009G_47 it's a big undertaking i stand here before you tonight as an ambassador for my whole team there's a lot of people working on this right now we've got thirty three cameras out this moment we
JamesBalog_2009G_48 just had thirty three cameras shoot about half an hour ago
JamesBalog_2009G_49 all across the northern hemisphere watching what's happened
JamesBalog_2009G_50 and we've spent a lot of time in the field it's been a fantastic amount of work we've been out for two and a half years and we've got about another two and a half years yet to go
JamesBalog_2009G_51 that's only half our job the other half of our job is to tell the story to the global
JamesBalog_2009G_52 scientists have collected this kind of information
JamesBalog_2009G_53 off and on over the years but a lot of it stays within the science community similarly
JamesBalog_2009G_54 a lot of art projects stay in the art community and i feel very much a responsibility through mechanisms like ted and like our relationship with the obama white house with the senate with john
JamesBalog_2009G_55 to influence policy as much as possible with these pictures as well we've done films we've done books we have more coming we have a site on google earth
JamesBalog_2009G_56 that google earth was was generous enough to give us 
JamesBalog_2009G_57 and so forth because we feel very much the need to tell this story because it is such an immediate evidence of ongoing climate change right now
JamesBalog_2009G_58 now one bit of science before we get into the visuals if everybody in the developed world
JamesBalog_2009G_59 understood this graph and emblazoned it on the inside of their foreheads there would be no further societal argument about climate change because
JamesBalog_2009G_60 this is the story that counts everything else you hear is just propaganda and confusion 
JamesBalog_2009G_61 key issues this is a four hundred thousand year record this exact same pattern is seen going back now almost a million years before our current time
JamesBalog_2009G_62 several things are important number one temperature and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere go up and down basically in sync you can see that from the orange line and the blue line
JamesBalog_2009G_63 nature naturally has allowed carbon dioxide to go up to two hundred and eighty parts per million that's the natural cycle
JamesBalog_2009G_64 goes up to two hundred and eighty and then drops for various reasons that aren't important to discuss right here but two
JamesBalog_2009G_65 is the peak right now if you look at the top right part of that graph we're at three hundred and eighty five parts per million we are way way outside the normal natural variability
JamesBalog_2009G_66 earth is having a fever in the past hundred years the temperature of the earth has gone up
JamesBalog_2009G_67 one point three degrees fahrenheit 75 degrees
JamesBalog_2009G_68 it's going to keep going up because we keep dumping fossil fuels into the atmosphere
JamesBalog_2009G_69 at the rate of about two and a half parts per million per year it's been a remorseless steady increase we have to turn that around
JamesBalog_2009G_70 that's the crux and someday i hope to emblazon that across times square in new york and a lot of other places but anyway
JamesBalog_2009G_71 off to the world of ice we're now at the columbia glacier in alaska this is a view of what's called the calving face this is what one of our cameras saw over the course of a few months
JamesBalog_2009G_72 you see the glacier flowing in from the right
JamesBalog_2009G_73 dropping off into the sea camera shooting every hour if you look in the in the middle background you can see the calving face bobbing up and down like a yo yo
JamesBalog_2009G_74 that means that glacier's floating and it's unstable and you're about to see the consequences of that floating to give you
JamesBalog_2009G_75 a little bit of a sense of scale that calving face in this picture
JamesBalog_2009G_76 is about
JamesBalog_2009G_77 three hundred and twenty five feet tall that's thirty two stories this is not a little cliff this is like a major office building in an urban center 
JamesBalog_2009G_78 the calving face is the wall where the visible ice breaks off but in fact it goes down below sea level
JamesBalog_2009G_79 another couple thousand feet so there's a wall of ice a couple thousand feet deep going down to bedrock if
JamesBalog_2009G_80 if the glacier's grounded on bedrock and floating if it isn't here
JamesBalog_2009G_81 's what columbia's done this is in south central alaska 
JamesBalog_2009G_82 this was an aerial picture i did one day in june three years ago this is an aerial picture we did this year 
JamesBalog_2009G_83 that's the retreat
JamesBalog_2009G_84 the main stem the main flow of the glacier is coming from the right
JamesBalog_2009G_85 and
JamesBalog_2009G_86 it's going very rapidly up that stem we're going to be up there in just a few more weeks and we expect that it's probably retreated another half a mile but if i
JamesBalog_2009G_87 if i got there and discovered that it had collapsed and it was five miles further back i wouldn't be the least bit surprised now it's really hard to grasp the scale of
JamesBalog_2009G_88 these places because as the glaciers one of the things is that places like alaska and greenland are huge they're not normal landscapes
JamesBalog_2009G_89 but as the glaciers are are retreating they're also deflating like air is being let out of a balloon
JamesBalog_2009G_90 and so there are features on this landscape there's a ridge right in the middle of the picture up above where that arrow comes in
JamesBalog_2009G_91 that shows you that a little bit there's a marker line called the trim line
JamesBalog_2009G_92 above our little red
JamesBalog_2009G_93 illustration there this is something no self respecting photographer would ever do you put some cheesy illustration on your shot right and
JamesBalog_2009G_94 yet you have to do it sometimes to narrate these points but in any case the deflation of this glacier since one thousand nine hundred and eighty four has been
JamesBalog_2009G_95 higher than the eiffel tower higher than the empire state building a tremendous amount of ice has been let out of these valleys as it's retreated and deflated gone back
JamesBalog_2009G_96 up valley
JamesBalog_2009G_97 these changes in the alpine world are accelerating 
JamesBalog_2009G_98 it's not static particularly in the world of sea ice
JamesBalog_2009G_99 the rate of natural change is outstripping predictions of just a few years ago and the processes
JamesBalog_2009G_100 either are accelerating or the predictions were too low to begin with but in any case there are big big changes happening as we speak
JamesBalog_2009G_101 here's another time lapse shot of columbia 
JamesBalog_2009G_102 and you see where it ended in these various spring days june may then october now we turn on our time lapse this camera was shooting every hour 
JamesBalog_2009G_103 geologic process in action here and everybody says well don't they advance in the winter time no it was retreating through the winter because it's an unhealthy glacier finally catches up to itself it advances
JamesBalog_2009G_104 you can look at these pictures over and over again because there's such a strange
JamesBalog_2009G_105 bizarre fascination in seeing these things you don't normally get to see come alive we've been talking about seeing is believing and seeing the unseen at
JamesBalog_2009G_106 ted global that's what you see with these cameras the images make the
JamesBalog_2009G_107 huge crevasses open up these great ice islands break off
JamesBalog_2009G_108 and now watch this this has been the springtime this year a
JamesBalog_2009G_109 huge collapse that happened in about a month the loss of all that ice
JamesBalog_2009G_110 so that's where we started three years ago way out on the left and that's where we were a few months ago the last time we went into columbia
JamesBalog_2009G_111 to give you a feeling for the scale of the retreat we did another cheesy illustration
JamesBalog_2009G_112 with british double decker buses if you line up two hundred and ninety five of those nose to tail that's about how far back that was
JamesBalog_2009G_113 on up to iceland one of my favorite glaciers the slheimajkull
JamesBalog_2009G_114 and here if you watch you can see the terminus retreating you can see this river being formed you can see it deflating
JamesBalog_2009G_115 without the photographic process you would never see this this is invisible you can stand up there your whole life and you would never see this but the camera records it
JamesBalog_2009G_116 so we wind time backwards now
JamesBalog_2009G_117 we go back a couple years in time that's where it started
JamesBalog_2009G_118 that's where it ended a few months ago
JamesBalog_2009G_119 and on up to greenland
JamesBalog_2009G_120 the smaller the ice mass the faster it responds to climate greenland took a little while to start reacting to the warming climate of the past
JamesBalog_2009G_121 century but it really started galloping along about twenty years ago and there's been a tremendous
JamesBalog_2009G_122 increase in the temperature up there it's a
JamesBalog_2009G_123 big place that's all ice all those colors are ice and it goes up to about two miles thick
JamesBalog_2009G_124 just a gigantic dome that comes in from the coast and rises in the middle
JamesBalog_2009G_125 the one glacier up in greenland that puts more ice into the global ocean than all the other glaciers in the northern hemisphere combined is the
JamesBalog_2009G_126 we have some cameras on the south
JamesBalog_2009G_127 edge of the ilulissat watching the calving face as it goes through this dramatic retreat here's a two year record of what that looks like helicopter in front of the calving face for scale 
JamesBalog_2009G_128 quickly dwarfed the calving face is four and a half miles across and in this shot as we pull back you're only seeing about a mile and a half so imagine how big this is and how much ice is charging out the interior of greenland is to the right it's
JamesBalog_2009G_129 flowing out to the atlantic ocean on the left
JamesBalog_2009G_130 many many many many times the size of this building are roaring out to sea we just downloaded these pictures a couple weeks ago as you can see june 25th
JamesBalog_2009G_131 monster calving events happened i'll show you one of those in a second this glacier has doubled its flow speed
JamesBalog_2009G_132 in the past fifteen years it now goes at one hundred and twenty five feet a day dumping all this ice into the ocean
JamesBalog_2009G_133 it tends to go in these pulses about every three days but on average one hundred and twenty five feet a day twice the rate it did twenty years ago 
JamesBalog_2009G_134 okay we had a team
JamesBalog_2009G_135 out watching this glacier and we recorded the biggest calving event that's ever been put on film we had nine cameras going this is what a couple of the cameras saw
JamesBalog_2009G_136 icebergs rolling over
JamesBalog_2009G_137 how big was that it's hard to get it
JamesBalog_2009G_138 an illustration again gives you a feeling for scale a
JamesBalog_2009G_139 mile of retreat in seventy five minutes across the calving face in that particular event three miles wide 
JamesBalog_2009G_140 the block was three fifths of a mile deep and if you compare the expanse of the calving face to the tower bridge in london about twenty bridges wide
JamesBalog_2009G_141 or if you take an american reference
JamesBalog_2009G_142 to the u s capitol building and you pack three thousand capitol buildings into that block it would be equivalent to how large that block was
JamesBalog_2009G_143 seventy five minutes
JamesBalog_2009G_144 now i've
JamesBalog_2009G_145 come to the conclusion after spending a lot of time in this climate change world
JamesBalog_2009G_146 that we don't have a problem of economics technology and public policy we have a problem of perception the policy and the economics and the technology are serious enough
JamesBalog_2009G_147 issues but we actually can deal with them i'm certain that we can
JamesBalog_2009G_148 but what we have is a perception problem because not enough people really get it yet you're an elite audience you get it
JamesBalog_2009G_149 fortunately a lot of the political leaders in the major countries of the world are an elite audience that for the most part gets it now but we still need to bring a lot of people along with us and that
JamesBalog_2009G_150 's where i think organizations like ted like the extreme ice survey can have a terrific impact on human perception and bring us along because i believe we have an opportunity 
JamesBalog_2009G_151 right now we are nearly on the edge of a crisis but we still have an opportunity to face the greatest challenge of our generation and in fact
JamesBalog_2009G_152 of our century
JamesBalog_2009G_153 this is a terrific terrific call to arms to do the right thing for ourselves and for the future i hope that we have the wisdom to let the angels of our better nature rise to the occasion and do what needs to be done thank you
