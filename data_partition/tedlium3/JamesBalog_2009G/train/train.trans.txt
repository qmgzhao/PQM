JamesBalog_2009G_1 when the two look at each other art of course
JamesBalog_2009G_3 the psyche the emotions the unconscious at times and of course the aesthetic science
JamesBalog_2009G_6 human understanding together to merging the art and science
JamesBalog_2009G_9 am firmly of the belief that photography video film have tremendous powers for helping us understand and shape
JamesBalog_2009G_10 the way we think about nature and about ourselves
JamesBalog_2009G_12 i'm fascinated by the beauty of it the mutability of it the malleability of it and the fabulous shapes in which it can carve itself these first images are from greenland
JamesBalog_2009G_18 all of that strip
JamesBalog_2009G_19 in the world of the arctic and alpine environments where the ice is it's real and it's present the changes are happening they're very visible they're photographable they're measurable
JamesBalog_2009G_24 in these images we see ice from enormous glaciers ice sheets that are hundreds of thousands of years old breaking up into chunks and chunk by chunk by chunk iceberg by iceberg turning into global sea
JamesBalog_2009G_26 i was still a skeptic about climate change until about ten years ago because i thought
JamesBalog_2009G_27 the story of climate change was based on computer models i hadn't realized it was based on concrete measurements
JamesBalog_2009G_28 of what the 
JamesBalog_2009G_29 ancient climates were as recorded in the ice sheets as recorded in deep ocean sediments as recorded in lake sediments tree rings and a lot of other
JamesBalog_2009G_30 ways of measuring temperature when i realized that climate change was real and it was not based on computer models i decided that one day i would i would do a project looking at trying to manifest climate change photographically and that led me to this
JamesBalog_2009G_32 after that assignment was finished i got the idea that i should shoot
JamesBalog_2009G_33 in time lapse photography that i should station a camera or two at a glacier and let it shoot every fifteen minutes or every hour or whatever
JamesBalog_2009G_37 time in my career trying to design build and deploy out in the field these twenty five time lapse cameras
JamesBalog_2009G_39 solar panels power them power goes into a battery there is a custom made computer that tells the
JamesBalog_2009G_41 we just had a number of
JamesBalog_2009G_43 the cameras shoot roughly every hour some of them shoot every half hour every fifteen minutes every five minutes here's a time lapse of one of the time lapse units being made
JamesBalog_2009G_52 scientists have collected this kind of information
JamesBalog_2009G_55 to influence policy as much as possible with these pictures as well we've done films we've done books we have more coming we have a site on google earth
JamesBalog_2009G_57 and so forth because we feel very much the need to tell this story because it is such an immediate evidence of ongoing climate change right now
JamesBalog_2009G_58 now one bit of science before we get into the visuals if everybody in the developed world
JamesBalog_2009G_63 nature naturally has allowed carbon dioxide to go up to two hundred and eighty parts per million that's the natural cycle
JamesBalog_2009G_65 is the peak right now if you look at the top right part of that graph we're at three hundred and eighty five parts per million we are way way outside the normal natural variability
JamesBalog_2009G_69 at the rate of about two and a half parts per million per year it's been a remorseless steady increase we have to turn that around
JamesBalog_2009G_72 you see the glacier flowing in from the right
JamesBalog_2009G_74 that means that glacier's floating and it's unstable and you're about to see the consequences of that floating to give you
JamesBalog_2009G_75 a little bit of a sense of scale that calving face in this picture
JamesBalog_2009G_80 if the glacier's grounded on bedrock and floating if it isn't here
JamesBalog_2009G_82 this was an aerial picture i did one day in june three years ago this is an aerial picture we did this year 
JamesBalog_2009G_83 that's the retreat
JamesBalog_2009G_86 it's going very rapidly up that stem we're going to be up there in just a few more weeks and we expect that it's probably retreated another half a mile but if i
JamesBalog_2009G_87 if i got there and discovered that it had collapsed and it was five miles further back i wouldn't be the least bit surprised now it's really hard to grasp the scale of
JamesBalog_2009G_89 but as the glaciers are are retreating they're also deflating like air is being let out of a balloon
JamesBalog_2009G_90 and so there are features on this landscape there's a ridge right in the middle of the picture up above where that arrow comes in
JamesBalog_2009G_91 that shows you that a little bit there's a marker line called the trim line
JamesBalog_2009G_94 yet you have to do it sometimes to narrate these points but in any case the deflation of this glacier since one thousand nine hundred and eighty four has been
JamesBalog_2009G_95 higher than the eiffel tower higher than the empire state building a tremendous amount of ice has been let out of these valleys as it's retreated and deflated gone back
JamesBalog_2009G_96 up valley
JamesBalog_2009G_97 these changes in the alpine world are accelerating 
JamesBalog_2009G_111 to give you a feeling for the scale of the retreat we did another cheesy illustration
JamesBalog_2009G_112 with british double decker buses if you line up two hundred and ninety five of those nose to tail that's about how far back that was
JamesBalog_2009G_115 without the photographic process you would never see this this is invisible you can stand up there your whole life and you would never see this but the camera records it
JamesBalog_2009G_116 so we wind time backwards now
JamesBalog_2009G_119 and on up to greenland
JamesBalog_2009G_124 just a gigantic dome that comes in from the coast and rises in the middle
JamesBalog_2009G_126 we have some cameras on the south
JamesBalog_2009G_135 out watching this glacier and we recorded the biggest calving event that's ever been put on film we had nine cameras going this is what a couple of the cameras saw
JamesBalog_2009G_139 mile of retreat in seventy five minutes across the calving face in that particular event three miles wide 
JamesBalog_2009G_140 the block was three fifths of a mile deep and if you compare the expanse of the calving face to the tower bridge in london about twenty bridges wide
JamesBalog_2009G_141 or if you take an american reference
JamesBalog_2009G_142 to the u s capitol building and you pack three thousand capitol buildings into that block it would be equivalent to how large that block was
JamesBalog_2009G_143 seventy five minutes
JamesBalog_2009G_145 come to the conclusion after spending a lot of time in this climate change world
JamesBalog_2009G_146 that we don't have a problem of economics technology and public policy we have a problem of perception the policy and the economics and the technology are serious enough
JamesBalog_2009G_147 issues but we actually can deal with them i'm certain that we can
JamesBalog_2009G_148 but what we have is a perception problem because not enough people really get it yet you're an elite audience you get it
JamesBalog_2009G_149 fortunately a lot of the political leaders in the major countries of the world are an elite audience that for the most part gets it now but we still need to bring a lot of people along with us and that
JamesBalog_2009G_150 's where i think organizations like ted like the extreme ice survey can have a terrific impact on human perception and bring us along because i believe we have an opportunity 
JamesBalog_2009G_151 right now we are nearly on the edge of a crisis but we still have an opportunity to face the greatest challenge of our generation and in fact
