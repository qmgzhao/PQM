JamesBalog_2009G_0 most of the time art and science stare at each other across a gulf of mutual incomprehension there is great confusion
JamesBalog_2009G_2 looks at the world through
JamesBalog_2009G_5 in the extreme ice survey we're dedicated to bringing those two parts of
JamesBalog_2009G_8 specifically i as a person who's been a professional nature photographer my whole adult life
JamesBalog_2009G_11 in relationship to nature in this project we're specifically interested of course in ice 
JamesBalog_2009G_14 canary in the global coal mine
JamesBalog_2009G_15 it's the place where we can see and touch and hear and feel climate change in action
JamesBalog_2009G_17 what do the computer models say about this that and the other thing
JamesBalog_2009G_20 ninety five percent of the glaciers in the world are retreating or shrinking 
JamesBalog_2009G_21 that's outside antarctica ninety five percent of the glaciers in the world are retreating or shrinking and that's because the precipitation patterns and the temperature patterns are changing 
JamesBalog_2009G_22 there is no significant scientific dispute about that
JamesBalog_2009G_23 's been observed it's measured it's bomb proof information and the great irony and tragedy of our time is that a lot of the general public thinks that science is still arguing about that science is not arguing about that
JamesBalog_2009G_31 i was working on a national geographic assignment conventional single frame still photography and one crazy day i got the idea that i should
JamesBalog_2009G_35 incautiously turned that idea of a couple of time lapse cameras into
JamesBalog_2009G_36 cameras and the next six months of my life were the hardest
JamesBalog_2009G_42 cameras out on the greenland ice sheet we actually drilled holes into the ice way deep down below the thawing level and had some cameras out there for the past month and a half or so actually there's still a camera out there right now in any case
JamesBalog_2009G_44 i personally obsessed about every nut bolt and washer in these crazy things i spent half my life at our local hardware store during the months when we built these units originally 
JamesBalog_2009G_46 our time lapse units are in alaska the rockies greenland and iceland and we have repeat photography positions that is places we just visit on an annual basis in british columbia the alps and bolivia 
JamesBalog_2009G_47 it's a big undertaking i stand here before you tonight as an ambassador for my whole team there's a lot of people working on this right now we've got thirty three cameras out this moment we
JamesBalog_2009G_48 just had thirty three cameras shoot about half an hour ago
JamesBalog_2009G_49 all across the northern hemisphere watching what's happened
JamesBalog_2009G_50 and we've spent a lot of time in the field it's been a fantastic amount of work we've been out for two and a half years and we've got about another two and a half years yet to go
JamesBalog_2009G_54 a lot of art projects stay in the art community and i feel very much a responsibility through mechanisms like ted and like our relationship with the obama white house with the senate with john
JamesBalog_2009G_56 that google earth was was generous enough to give us 
JamesBalog_2009G_60 this is the story that counts everything else you hear is just propaganda and confusion 
JamesBalog_2009G_61 key issues this is a four hundred thousand year record this exact same pattern is seen going back now almost a million years before our current time
JamesBalog_2009G_62 several things are important number one temperature and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere go up and down basically in sync you can see that from the orange line and the blue line
JamesBalog_2009G_64 goes up to two hundred and eighty and then drops for various reasons that aren't important to discuss right here but two
JamesBalog_2009G_68 it's going to keep going up because we keep dumping fossil fuels into the atmosphere
JamesBalog_2009G_71 off to the world of ice we're now at the columbia glacier in alaska this is a view of what's called the calving face this is what one of our cameras saw over the course of a few months
JamesBalog_2009G_76 is about
JamesBalog_2009G_77 three hundred and twenty five feet tall that's thirty two stories this is not a little cliff this is like a major office building in an urban center 
JamesBalog_2009G_79 another couple thousand feet so there's a wall of ice a couple thousand feet deep going down to bedrock if
JamesBalog_2009G_81 's what columbia's done this is in south central alaska 
JamesBalog_2009G_84 the main stem the main flow of the glacier is coming from the right
JamesBalog_2009G_88 these places because as the glaciers one of the things is that places like alaska and greenland are huge they're not normal landscapes
JamesBalog_2009G_93 illustration there this is something no self respecting photographer would ever do you put some cheesy illustration on your shot right and
JamesBalog_2009G_99 the rate of natural change is outstripping predictions of just a few years ago and the processes
JamesBalog_2009G_101 here's another time lapse shot of columbia 
JamesBalog_2009G_102 and you see where it ended in these various spring days june may then october now we turn on our time lapse this camera was shooting every hour 
JamesBalog_2009G_103 geologic process in action here and everybody says well don't they advance in the winter time no it was retreating through the winter because it's an unhealthy glacier finally catches up to itself it advances
JamesBalog_2009G_104 you can look at these pictures over and over again because there's such a strange
JamesBalog_2009G_106 ted global that's what you see with these cameras the images make the
JamesBalog_2009G_107 huge crevasses open up these great ice islands break off
JamesBalog_2009G_108 and now watch this this has been the springtime this year a
JamesBalog_2009G_109 huge collapse that happened in about a month the loss of all that ice
JamesBalog_2009G_110 so that's where we started three years ago way out on the left and that's where we were a few months ago the last time we went into columbia
JamesBalog_2009G_113 on up to iceland one of my favorite glaciers the slheimajkull
JamesBalog_2009G_117 we go back a couple years in time that's where it started
JamesBalog_2009G_118 that's where it ended a few months ago
JamesBalog_2009G_120 the smaller the ice mass the faster it responds to climate greenland took a little while to start reacting to the warming climate of the past
JamesBalog_2009G_121 century but it really started galloping along about twenty years ago and there's been a tremendous
JamesBalog_2009G_122 increase in the temperature up there it's a
JamesBalog_2009G_125 the one glacier up in greenland that puts more ice into the global ocean than all the other glaciers in the northern hemisphere combined is the
JamesBalog_2009G_127 edge of the ilulissat watching the calving face as it goes through this dramatic retreat here's a two year record of what that looks like helicopter in front of the calving face for scale 
JamesBalog_2009G_128 quickly dwarfed the calving face is four and a half miles across and in this shot as we pull back you're only seeing about a mile and a half so imagine how big this is and how much ice is charging out the interior of greenland is to the right it's
JamesBalog_2009G_129 flowing out to the atlantic ocean on the left
JamesBalog_2009G_130 many many many many times the size of this building are roaring out to sea we just downloaded these pictures a couple weeks ago as you can see june 25th
JamesBalog_2009G_131 monster calving events happened i'll show you one of those in a second this glacier has doubled its flow speed
JamesBalog_2009G_137 how big was that it's hard to get it
JamesBalog_2009G_153 this is a terrific terrific call to arms to do the right thing for ourselves and for the future i hope that we have the wisdom to let the angels of our better nature rise to the occasion and do what needs to be done thank you
