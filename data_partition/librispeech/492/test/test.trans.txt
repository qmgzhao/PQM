492-131899-0001 BLEW A GALE AND RETARDED THE STEAMER THE RANGOON ROLLED HEAVILY AND THE PASSENGERS BECAME IMPATIENT OF THE LONG MONSTROUS WAVES WHICH THE WIND RAISED BEFORE THEIR PATH
492-131899-0002 A SORT OF TEMPEST AROSE ON THE THIRD OF NOVEMBER
492-131899-0003 ABOUT WITH FURY AND THE WAVES RUNNING HIGH THE RANGOON REEFED ALL HER SAILS
492-131899-0004 RIGGING PROVED TOO MUCH
492-131899-0005 THE STEAMER WAS FORCED TO PROCEED SLOWLY AND THE CAPTAIN ESTIMATED THAT SHE WOULD REACH HONG KONG
492-131899-0006 FIX DID NOT LOOK AT THE STATE OF THINGS IN THE SAME LIGHT THE STORM GREATLY PLEASED HIM HIS SATISFACTION WOULD HAVE BEEN COMPLETE HAD THE RANGOON BEEN FORCED TO RETREAT

492-131899-0008 HE MADE NO ACCOUNT OF THIS INCONVENIENCE AND WHILST HIS BODY WAS WRITHING UNDER THEIR EFFECTS HIS SPIRIT BOUNDED WITH HOPEFUL EXULTATION
492-131899-0009 ENRAGED BEYOND EXPRESSION BY THE
492-131899-0010 WEATHER EVERYTHING HAD GONE SO WELL TILL NOW EARTH AND SEA HAD SEEMED TO BE AT HIS MASTER'S SERVICE STEAMERS AND RAILWAYS OBEYED HIM

492-131899-0016 AND THE STORM LESSENED ITS VIOLENCE THE WIND VEERED SOUTHWARD AND WAS ONCE MORE FAVOURABLE
492-131899-0017 SIGNALLED UNTIL FIVE O'CLOCK ON THE MORNING OF THE SIXTH THE STEAMER WAS DUE ON THE FIFTH PHILEAS FOGG WAS TWENTY FOUR HOURS BEHIND HAND AND THE YOKOHAMA STEAMER WOULD OF COURSE BE MISSED

492-131899-0025 IN HIS DELIGHT EXCLAIMING PILOT YOU ARE THE BEST OF GOOD FELLOWS THE PILOT PROBABLY DOES NOT KNOW TO THIS DAY WHY HIS RESPONSES WON HIM THIS ENTHUSIASTIC GREETING
492-131899-0026 HE REMOUNTED THE BRIDGE AND GUIDED THE STEAMER THROUGH THE FLOTILLA OF JUNKS
492-131899-0027 AND THE PASSENGERS WERE GOING ASHORE CHANCE HAD STRANGELY FAVOURED PHILEAS FOGG
492-131899-0028 SHE WOULD HAVE LEFT ON THE SIXTH OF NOVEMBER AND THE PASSENGERS FOR JAPAN WOULD HAVE
492-131899-0029 OF THE NEXT STEAMER MISTER FOGG WAS IT IS TRUE TWENTY FOUR HOURS BEHIND HIS TIME BUT THIS COULD NOT SERIOUSLY IMPERIL THE REMAINDER OF HIS TOUR THE STEAMER
492-131899-0030 WHICH CROSSED THE PACIFIC FROM YOKOHAMA TO SAN FRANCISCO MADE A DIRECT CONNECTION WITH THAT FROM HONG KONG AND IT COULD NOT SAIL UNTIL THE LATTER REACHED YOKOHAMA
492-131899-0031 AND IF MISTER FOGG WAS TWENTY FOUR HOURS LATE ON REACHING YOKOHAMA THIS TIME WOULD NO DOUBT
492-131899-0032 IN THE VOYAGE OF TWENTY TWO DAYS ACROSS THE PACIFIC HE FOUND HIMSELF THEN ABOUT TWENTY FOUR HOURS BEHIND HAND THIRTY FIVE DAYS AFTER LEAVING LONDON THE
