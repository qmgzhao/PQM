115-122944-0035 THE CRIMINAL IS OFTEN ENOUGH NOT EQUAL TO HIS DEED HE EXTENUATES AND MALIGNS IT

115-122944-0047 TO REJOICE ON ACCOUNT OF PRAISE IS IN MANY CASES MERELY POLITENESS OF HEART AND THE VERY OPPOSITE OF VANITY OF SPIRIT
115-122944-0048 EVEN CONCUBINAGE HAS BEEN CORRUPTED BY MARRIAGE
115-122944-0049 HE WHO EXULTS AT THE STAKE DOES NOT TRIUMPH OVER PAIN
115-122944-0050 WHEN WE HAVE TO CHANGE AN OPINION ABOUT ANY ONE WE CHARGE HEAVILY TO HIS ACCOUNT THE INCONVENIENCE HE THEREBY CAUSES US
115-122944-0051 A NATION IS A DETOUR OF NATURE

115-122944-0053 IN THE EYES OF ALL TRUE WOMEN SCIENCE IS HOSTILE TO THE SENSE OF SHAME THEY FEEL AS IF ONE WISHED TO PEEP UNDER THEIR SKIN WITH IT OR WORSE STILL UNDER THEIR DRESS AND FINERY
115-122944-0054 THE MORE ABSTRACT THE TRUTH YOU WISH TO TEACH THE MORE MUST YOU ALLURE THE SENSES TO IT
115-122944-0055 THE SEXES DECEIVE THEMSELVES ABOUT EACH OTHER THE REASON IS THAT IN REALITY THEY HONOUR AND LOVE ONLY THEMSELVES OR THEIR OWN IDEAL TO EXPRESS IT MORE AGREEABLY THUS MAN WISHES WOMAN TO BE PEACEABLE
115-122944-0056 BUT IN FACT WOMAN IS ESSENTIALLY UNPEACEABLE LIKE THE CAT HOWEVER WELL SHE MAY HAVE ASSUMED THE PEACEABLE DEMEANOUR
115-122944-0057 ONE IS PUNISHED BEST FOR ONE'S VIRTUES

115-122944-0060 PHARISAISM IS NOT A DETERIORATION OF THE GOOD MAN A CONSIDERABLE PART OF IT IS RATHER AN ESSENTIAL CONDITION OF BEING GOOD
115-122944-0061 THE ONE SEEKS AN ACCOUCHEUR FOR HIS THOUGHTS THE OTHER SEEKS SOME ONE WHOM HE CAN ASSIST A GOOD CONVERSATION THUS ORIGINATES
115-122944-0062 IN INTERCOURSE WITH SCHOLARS AND ARTISTS ONE READILY MAKES MISTAKES OF OPPOSITE KINDS IN A REMARKABLE SCHOLAR ONE NOT INFREQUENTLY FINDS A MEDIOCRE MAN AND OFTEN EVEN IN A MEDIOCRE ARTIST
115-122944-0063 ONE FINDS A VERY REMARKABLE MAN
115-122944-0064 WE DO THE SAME WHEN AWAKE AS WHEN DREAMING WE ONLY INVENT AND IMAGINE HIM WITH WHOM WE HAVE INTERCOURSE AND FORGET IT IMMEDIATELY
115-122944-0065 IN REVENGE AND IN LOVE WOMAN IS MORE BARBAROUS THAN MAN

115-122944-0083 NOT ONLY OUR REASON BUT ALSO OUR CONSCIENCE TRUCKLES TO OUR STRONGEST IMPULSE THE TYRANT IN US
115-122944-0084 ONE MUST REPAY GOOD AND ILL BUT WHY JUST TO THE PERSON WHO DID US GOOD OR ILL
115-122944-0085 POETS ACT SHAMELESSLY TOWARDS THEIR EXPERIENCES THEY EXPLOIT THEM
115-122944-0086 OUR FELLOW CREATURE IS NOT OUR NEIGHBOUR BUT OUR NEIGHBOUR'S NEIGHBOUR SO THINKS EVERY NATION
115-122944-0087 LOVE BRINGS TO LIGHT THE NOBLE AND HIDDEN QUALITIES OF A LOVER HIS RARE AND EXCEPTIONAL TRAITS IT IS THUS LIABLE TO BE DECEPTIVE AS TO HIS NORMAL CHARACTER
115-122944-0088 JESUS SAID TO HIS JEWS THE LAW WAS FOR SERVANTS LOVE GOD AS I LOVE HIM AS HIS SON WHAT HAVE WE SONS OF GOD TO DO WITH MORALS
115-122944-0089 IN SIGHT OF EVERY PARTY A SHEPHERD HAS ALWAYS NEED OF A BELL WETHER OR HE HAS HIMSELF TO BE A WETHER OCCASIONALLY
115-122944-0090 ONE MAY INDEED LIE WITH THE MOUTH BUT WITH THE ACCOMPANYING GRIMACE ONE NEVERTHELESS TELLS THE TRUTH
115-122944-0091 TO VIGOROUS MEN INTIMACY IS A MATTER OF SHAME AND SOMETHING PRECIOUS
115-122944-0092 CHRISTIANITY GAVE EROS POISON TO DRINK HE DID NOT DIE OF IT CERTAINLY BUT DEGENERATED TO VICE
115-122944-0093 TO TALK MUCH ABOUT ONESELF MAY ALSO BE A MEANS OF CONCEALING ONESELF
115-122944-0094 IN PRAISE THERE IS MORE OBTRUSIVENESS THAN IN BLAME
115-122944-0095 PITY HAS AN ALMOST LUDICROUS EFFECT ON A MAN OF KNOWLEDGE LIKE TENDER HANDS ON A CYCLOPS
115-122944-0096 ONE OCCASIONALLY EMBRACES SOME ONE OR OTHER OUT OF LOVE TO MANKIND BECAUSE ONE CANNOT EMBRACE ALL BUT THIS IS WHAT ONE MUST NEVER CONFESS TO THE INDIVIDUAL
115-122944-0097 YE UTILITARIANS YE TOO LOVE THE UTILE ONLY AS A VEHICLE FOR YOUR INCLINATIONS YE TOO REALLY FIND THE NOISE OF ITS WHEELS INSUPPORTABLE
115-122944-0098 ONE LOVES ULTIMATELY ONE'S DESIRES NOT THE THING DESIRED
115-122944-0099 THE VANITY OF OTHERS IS ONLY COUNTER TO OUR TASTE WHEN IT IS COUNTER TO OUR VANITY
115-122944-0100 WITH REGARD TO WHAT TRUTHFULNESS IS PERHAPS NOBODY HAS EVER BEEN SUFFICIENTLY TRUTHFUL
115-122944-0101 ONE DOES NOT BELIEVE IN THE FOLLIES OF CLEVER MEN WHAT A FORFEITURE OF THE RIGHTS OF MAN
115-122944-0102 THE CONSEQUENCES OF OUR ACTIONS SEIZE US BY THE FORELOCK VERY INDIFFERENT TO THE FACT THAT WE HAVE MEANWHILE REFORMED
115-122944-0103 THERE IS AN INNOCENCE IN LYING WHICH IS THE SIGN OF GOOD FAITH IN A CAUSE
115-122944-0104 IT IS INHUMAN TO BLESS WHEN ONE IS BEING CURSED
115-122944-0105 THE FAMILIARITY OF SUPERIORS EMBITTERS ONE BECAUSE IT MAY NOT BE RETURNED
115-122944-0106 THERE IS A HAUGHTINESS OF KINDNESS WHICH HAS THE APPEARANCE OF WICKEDNESS
115-122944-0107 I DISLIKE HIM
