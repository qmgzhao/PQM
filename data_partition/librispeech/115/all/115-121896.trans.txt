115-121896-0000 IT IS BEYOND DOUBT THEN THAT THESE PATHS DO NOT LEAD TO HAPPINESS THEY CANNOT GUIDE ANYONE TO THE PROMISED GOAL NOW I WILL VERY BRIEFLY SHOW WHAT SERIOUS EVILS ARE INVOLVED IN FOLLOWING THEM JUST CONSIDER
115-121896-0001 IS IT THY ENDEAVOUR TO HEAP UP MONEY WHY THOU MUST WREST IT FROM ITS PRESENT POSSESSOR ART THOU MINDED TO PUT ON THE SPLENDOUR OF OFFICIAL DIGNITY THOU MUST BEG FROM THOSE WHO HAVE THE GIVING OF IT
115-121896-0002 MUST LOWER THYSELF TO THE HUMBLE POSTURE OF PETITION DOST THOU LONG FOR POWER THOU MUST FACE PERILS FOR THOU WILT BE AT THE MERCY OF THY SUBJECTS PLOTS IS GLORY THY AIM
115-121896-0003 THOU ART LURED ON THROUGH ALL MANNER OF HARDSHIPS AND THERE IS AN END TO THY PEACE OF MIND ART FAIN TO LEAD A LIFE OF PLEASURE YET WHO DOES NOT SCORN AND CONTEMN ONE
115-121896-0004 AGAIN ON HOW SLIGHT AND PERISHABLE A POSSESSION DO THEY RELY WHO SET BEFORE THEMSELVES BODILY EXCELLENCES CAN YE EVER SURPASS THE ELEPHANT IN BULK OR THE BULL IN STRENGTH
115-121896-0005 CAN YE EXCEL THE TIGER IN SWIFTNESS LOOK UPON THE INFINITUDE THE SOLIDITY THE SWIFT MOTION OF THE HEAVENS AND FOR ONCE CEASE TO ADMIRE THINGS MEAN AND WORTHLESS
115-121896-0006 AND YET THE HEAVENS ARE NOT SO MUCH TO BE ADMIRED ON THIS ACCOUNT AS FOR THE REASON WHICH GUIDES THEM
115-121896-0007 HOW SOON GONE MORE FLEETING THAN THE FADING BLOOM OF SPRING FLOWERS AND YET IF AS ARISTOTLE SAYS MEN SHOULD SEE WITH THE EYES OF LYNCEUS SO THAT THEIR SIGHT MIGHT PIERCE THROUGH OBSTRUCTIONS
115-121896-0008 APPEAR ALTOGETHER LOATHSOME WHEN ALL ITS INWARD PARTS LAY OPEN TO THE VIEW THEREFORE
115-121896-0009 OF A THREE DAYS FEVER FROM ALL WHICH CONSIDERATIONS WE MAY CONCLUDE AS A WHOLE THAT THESE THINGS WHICH CANNOT MAKE GOOD THE ADVANTAGES THEY PROMISE WHICH ARE NEVER MADE PERFECT BY THE ASSEMBLAGE OF ALL GOOD THINGS
115-121896-0010 THESE NEITHER LEAD AS BY WAYS TO HAPPINESS NOR THEMSELVES MAKE MEN COMPLETELY HAPPY
115-121896-0011 ALAS HOW WIDE ASTRAY DOTH IGNORANCE THESE WRETCHED MORTALS LEAD FROM TRUTH'S OWN WAY FOR NOT ON LEAFY STEMS DO YE WITHIN THE GREEN WOOD LOOK FOR GOLD NOR STRIP THE VINE FOR GEMS
115-121896-0012 YOUR NETS YE DO NOT SPREAD UPON THE HILL TOPS THAT THE GROANING BOARD WITH FISH BE FURNISHED IF YE ARE FAIN TO CHASE THE BOUNDING GOAT YE SWEEP NOT IN VAIN SEARCH THE OCEAN'S RUFFLED FACE

115-121896-0014 WHERE FISH AND PRICKLY URCHINS DO ABOUND ALL THIS THEY KNOW FULL WELL BUT NOT TO KNOW OR CARE WHERE HIDDEN LIES THE GOOD ALL HEARTS DESIRE THIS BLINDNESS THEY CAN BEAR
115-121896-0015 WITH GAZE ON EARTH LOW BENT THEY SEEK FOR THAT WHICH REACHETH FAR BEYOND THE STARRY FIRMAMENT WHAT CURSE SHALL I CALL DOWN ON HEARTS SO DULL
