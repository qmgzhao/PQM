115-122944-0031 CHARACTERISTIC OF THE TYPE FREE SPIRIT AS ITS NON FREEDOM
115-122944-0032 BY MEANS OF MUSIC THE VERY PASSIONS ENJOY THEMSELVES
115-122944-0033 A SIGN OF STRONG CHARACTER WHEN ONCE THE RESOLUTION HAS BEEN TAKEN TO SHUT THE EAR EVEN TO THE BEST COUNTER ARGUMENTS OCCASIONALLY THEREFORE A WILL TO STUPIDITY
115-122944-0034 THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS MORAL PHENOMENA BUT ONLY A MORAL INTERPRETATION OF PHENOMENA
115-122944-0035 THE CRIMINAL IS OFTEN ENOUGH NOT EQUAL TO HIS DEED HE EXTENUATES AND MALIGNS IT
115-122944-0036 THE ADVOCATES OF A CRIMINAL ARE SELDOM ARTISTS ENOUGH TO TURN THE BEAUTIFUL TERRIBLENESS OF THE DEED TO THE ADVANTAGE OF THE DOER
115-122944-0037 OUR VANITY IS MOST DIFFICULT TO WOUND JUST WHEN OUR PRIDE HAS BEEN WOUNDED
115-122944-0038 TO HIM WHO FEELS HIMSELF PREORDAINED TO CONTEMPLATION AND NOT TO BELIEF ALL BELIEVERS ARE TOO NOISY AND OBTRUSIVE HE GUARDS AGAINST THEM
115-122944-0039 YOU WANT TO PREPOSSESS HIM IN YOUR FAVOUR THEN YOU MUST BE EMBARRASSED BEFORE HIM
115-122944-0040 THE IMMENSE EXPECTATION WITH REGARD TO SEXUAL LOVE AND THE COYNESS IN THIS EXPECTATION SPOILS ALL THE PERSPECTIVES OF WOMEN AT THE OUTSET
115-122944-0041 WHERE THERE IS NEITHER LOVE NOR HATRED IN THE GAME WOMAN'S PLAY IS MEDIOCRE
115-122944-0042 THE GREAT EPOCHS OF OUR LIFE ARE AT THE POINTS WHEN WE GAIN COURAGE TO REBAPTIZE OUR BADNESS AS THE BEST IN US
115-122944-0043 THE WILL TO OVERCOME AN EMOTION IS ULTIMATELY ONLY THE WILL OF ANOTHER
115-122944-0044 OUR LOATHING OF DIRT MAY BE SO GREAT AS TO PREVENT OUR CLEANING OURSELVES JUSTIFYING OURSELVES
115-122944-0045 SENSUALITY OFTEN FORCES THE GROWTH OF LOVE TOO MUCH SO THAT ITS ROOT REMAINS WEAK AND IS EASILY TORN UP
115-122944-0046 IT IS A CURIOUS THING THAT GOD LEARNED GREEK WHEN HE WISHED TO TURN AUTHOR AND THAT HE DID NOT LEARN IT BETTER
115-122944-0047 TO REJOICE ON ACCOUNT OF PRAISE IS IN MANY CASES MERELY POLITENESS OF HEART AND THE VERY OPPOSITE OF VANITY OF SPIRIT
115-122944-0048 EVEN CONCUBINAGE HAS BEEN CORRUPTED BY MARRIAGE
115-122944-0049 HE WHO EXULTS AT THE STAKE DOES NOT TRIUMPH OVER PAIN
115-122944-0050 WHEN WE HAVE TO CHANGE AN OPINION ABOUT ANY ONE WE CHARGE HEAVILY TO HIS ACCOUNT THE INCONVENIENCE HE THEREBY CAUSES US
115-122944-0051 A NATION IS A DETOUR OF NATURE
115-122944-0052 YES AND THEN TO GET ROUND THEM
115-122944-0053 IN THE EYES OF ALL TRUE WOMEN SCIENCE IS HOSTILE TO THE SENSE OF SHAME THEY FEEL AS IF ONE WISHED TO PEEP UNDER THEIR SKIN WITH IT OR WORSE STILL UNDER THEIR DRESS AND FINERY
115-122944-0054 THE MORE ABSTRACT THE TRUTH YOU WISH TO TEACH THE MORE MUST YOU ALLURE THE SENSES TO IT
115-122944-0055 THE SEXES DECEIVE THEMSELVES ABOUT EACH OTHER THE REASON IS THAT IN REALITY THEY HONOUR AND LOVE ONLY THEMSELVES OR THEIR OWN IDEAL TO EXPRESS IT MORE AGREEABLY THUS MAN WISHES WOMAN TO BE PEACEABLE
115-122944-0056 BUT IN FACT WOMAN IS ESSENTIALLY UNPEACEABLE LIKE THE CAT HOWEVER WELL SHE MAY HAVE ASSUMED THE PEACEABLE DEMEANOUR
115-122944-0057 ONE IS PUNISHED BEST FOR ONE'S VIRTUES
115-122944-0058 HE WHO CANNOT FIND THE WAY TO HIS IDEAL LIVES MORE FRIVOLOUSLY AND SHAMELESSLY THAN THE MAN WITHOUT AN IDEAL
115-122944-0059 FROM THE SENSES ORIGINATE ALL TRUSTWORTHINESS ALL GOOD CONSCIENCE ALL EVIDENCE OF TRUTH
115-122944-0060 PHARISAISM IS NOT A DETERIORATION OF THE GOOD MAN A CONSIDERABLE PART OF IT IS RATHER AN ESSENTIAL CONDITION OF BEING GOOD
115-122944-0061 THE ONE SEEKS AN ACCOUCHEUR FOR HIS THOUGHTS THE OTHER SEEKS SOME ONE WHOM HE CAN ASSIST A GOOD CONVERSATION THUS ORIGINATES
115-122944-0062 IN INTERCOURSE WITH SCHOLARS AND ARTISTS ONE READILY MAKES MISTAKES OF OPPOSITE KINDS IN A REMARKABLE SCHOLAR ONE NOT INFREQUENTLY FINDS A MEDIOCRE MAN AND OFTEN EVEN IN A MEDIOCRE ARTIST
115-122944-0063 ONE FINDS A VERY REMARKABLE MAN
115-122944-0064 WE DO THE SAME WHEN AWAKE AS WHEN DREAMING WE ONLY INVENT AND IMAGINE HIM WITH WHOM WE HAVE INTERCOURSE AND FORGET IT IMMEDIATELY
115-122944-0065 IN REVENGE AND IN LOVE WOMAN IS MORE BARBAROUS THAN MAN
115-122944-0066 ADVICE AS A RIDDLE IF THE BAND IS NOT TO BREAK BITE IT FIRST SECURE TO MAKE
115-122944-0067 THE BELLY IS THE REASON WHY MAN DOES NOT SO READILY TAKE HIMSELF FOR A GOD
115-122944-0068 OUR VANITY WOULD LIKE WHAT WE DO BEST TO PASS PRECISELY FOR WHAT IS MOST DIFFICULT TO US CONCERNING THE ORIGIN OF MANY SYSTEMS OF MORALS
115-122944-0069 WHEN A WOMAN HAS SCHOLARLY INCLINATIONS THERE IS GENERALLY SOMETHING WRONG WITH HER SEXUAL NATURE BARRENNESS ITSELF CONDUCES TO A CERTAIN VIRILITY OF TASTE MAN INDEED IF I MAY SAY SO IS THE BARREN ANIMAL
115-122944-0070 COMPARING MAN AND WOMAN GENERALLY ONE MAY SAY THAT WOMAN WOULD NOT HAVE THE GENIUS FOR ADORNMENT IF SHE HAD NOT THE INSTINCT FOR THE SECONDARY ROLE
115-122944-0071 HE WHO FIGHTS WITH MONSTERS SHOULD BE CAREFUL LEST HE THEREBY BECOME A MONSTER AND IF THOU GAZE LONG INTO AN ABYSS THE ABYSS WILL ALSO GAZE INTO THEE
115-122944-0072 FROM OLD FLORENTINE NOVELS MOREOVER FROM LIFE BUONA FEMMINA E MALA FEMMINA VUOL BASTONE SACCHETTI NOVEMBER EIGHTY SIXTH
115-122944-0073 TO SEDUCE THEIR NEIGHBOUR TO A FAVOURABLE OPINION AND AFTERWARDS TO BELIEVE IMPLICITLY IN THIS OPINION OF THEIR NEIGHBOUR WHO CAN DO THIS CONJURING TRICK SO WELL AS WOMEN
115-122944-0074 THAT WHICH AN AGE CONSIDERS EVIL IS USUALLY AN UNSEASONABLE ECHO OF WHAT WAS FORMERLY CONSIDERED GOOD THE ATAVISM OF AN OLD IDEAL
115-122944-0075 AROUND THE HERO EVERYTHING BECOMES A TRAGEDY
115-122944-0076 IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO POSSESS A TALENT ONE MUST ALSO HAVE YOUR PERMISSION TO POSSESS IT
115-122944-0077 WHERE THERE IS THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE THERE IS ALWAYS PARADISE
115-122944-0078 WHAT IS DONE OUT OF LOVE ALWAYS TAKES PLACE BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL
115-122944-0079 OBJECTION EVASION JOYOUS DISTRUST AND LOVE OF IRONY ARE SIGNS OF HEALTH EVERYTHING ABSOLUTE BELONGS TO PATHOLOGY
115-122944-0080 THE SENSE OF THE TRAGIC INCREASES AND DECLINES WITH SENSUOUSNESS
115-122944-0081 INSANITY IN INDIVIDUALS IS SOMETHING RARE BUT IN GROUPS PARTIES NATIONS AND EPOCHS IT IS THE RULE
115-122944-0082 THE THOUGHT OF SUICIDE IS A GREAT CONSOLATION BY MEANS OF IT ONE GETS SUCCESSFULLY THROUGH MANY A BAD NIGHT
115-122944-0083 NOT ONLY OUR REASON BUT ALSO OUR CONSCIENCE TRUCKLES TO OUR STRONGEST IMPULSE THE TYRANT IN US
115-122944-0084 ONE MUST REPAY GOOD AND ILL BUT WHY JUST TO THE PERSON WHO DID US GOOD OR ILL
115-122944-0085 POETS ACT SHAMELESSLY TOWARDS THEIR EXPERIENCES THEY EXPLOIT THEM
115-122944-0086 OUR FELLOW CREATURE IS NOT OUR NEIGHBOUR BUT OUR NEIGHBOUR'S NEIGHBOUR SO THINKS EVERY NATION
115-122944-0087 LOVE BRINGS TO LIGHT THE NOBLE AND HIDDEN QUALITIES OF A LOVER HIS RARE AND EXCEPTIONAL TRAITS IT IS THUS LIABLE TO BE DECEPTIVE AS TO HIS NORMAL CHARACTER
115-122944-0088 JESUS SAID TO HIS JEWS THE LAW WAS FOR SERVANTS LOVE GOD AS I LOVE HIM AS HIS SON WHAT HAVE WE SONS OF GOD TO DO WITH MORALS
115-122944-0089 IN SIGHT OF EVERY PARTY A SHEPHERD HAS ALWAYS NEED OF A BELL WETHER OR HE HAS HIMSELF TO BE A WETHER OCCASIONALLY
115-122944-0090 ONE MAY INDEED LIE WITH THE MOUTH BUT WITH THE ACCOMPANYING GRIMACE ONE NEVERTHELESS TELLS THE TRUTH
115-122944-0091 TO VIGOROUS MEN INTIMACY IS A MATTER OF SHAME AND SOMETHING PRECIOUS
115-122944-0092 CHRISTIANITY GAVE EROS POISON TO DRINK HE DID NOT DIE OF IT CERTAINLY BUT DEGENERATED TO VICE
115-122944-0093 TO TALK MUCH ABOUT ONESELF MAY ALSO BE A MEANS OF CONCEALING ONESELF
115-122944-0094 IN PRAISE THERE IS MORE OBTRUSIVENESS THAN IN BLAME
115-122944-0095 PITY HAS AN ALMOST LUDICROUS EFFECT ON A MAN OF KNOWLEDGE LIKE TENDER HANDS ON A CYCLOPS
115-122944-0096 ONE OCCASIONALLY EMBRACES SOME ONE OR OTHER OUT OF LOVE TO MANKIND BECAUSE ONE CANNOT EMBRACE ALL BUT THIS IS WHAT ONE MUST NEVER CONFESS TO THE INDIVIDUAL
115-122944-0097 YE UTILITARIANS YE TOO LOVE THE UTILE ONLY AS A VEHICLE FOR YOUR INCLINATIONS YE TOO REALLY FIND THE NOISE OF ITS WHEELS INSUPPORTABLE
115-122944-0098 ONE LOVES ULTIMATELY ONE'S DESIRES NOT THE THING DESIRED
115-122944-0099 THE VANITY OF OTHERS IS ONLY COUNTER TO OUR TASTE WHEN IT IS COUNTER TO OUR VANITY
115-122944-0100 WITH REGARD TO WHAT TRUTHFULNESS IS PERHAPS NOBODY HAS EVER BEEN SUFFICIENTLY TRUTHFUL
115-122944-0101 ONE DOES NOT BELIEVE IN THE FOLLIES OF CLEVER MEN WHAT A FORFEITURE OF THE RIGHTS OF MAN
115-122944-0102 THE CONSEQUENCES OF OUR ACTIONS SEIZE US BY THE FORELOCK VERY INDIFFERENT TO THE FACT THAT WE HAVE MEANWHILE REFORMED
115-122944-0103 THERE IS AN INNOCENCE IN LYING WHICH IS THE SIGN OF GOOD FAITH IN A CAUSE
115-122944-0104 IT IS INHUMAN TO BLESS WHEN ONE IS BEING CURSED
115-122944-0105 THE FAMILIARITY OF SUPERIORS EMBITTERS ONE BECAUSE IT MAY NOT BE RETURNED
115-122944-0106 THERE IS A HAUGHTINESS OF KINDNESS WHICH HAS THE APPEARANCE OF WICKEDNESS
115-122944-0107 I DISLIKE HIM
