479-107480-0003 AND THEN I UNFOLDED TO HER THE INCIDENTS OF THE NIGHT BEFORE WHEN BY ASSUMING AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE THE POSITION OF VALET
479-107480-0004 WHEN WORD CAME OVER THE TELEPHONE TO DIGBY MISTER DE PELT'S VALET THAT MISTER DE PELT WAS AT THE ROCKERBILTS AND IN NO CONDITION TO GO HOME ALONE IT HAPPENED THAT IT WAS I WHO TOOK THE MESSAGE AND OBSERVING THAT DIGBY WAS ENGAGED IN A GAME OF BILLIARDS AND LIKELY TO REMAIN SO FOR SOME TIME TO COME
479-107480-0005 I DECIDED TO GO AFTER THE GENTLEMAN MYSELF WITHOUT SAYING ANYTHING TO DIGBY ABOUT IT MUFFLING MYSELF UP SO THAT NO ONE COULD RECOGNIZE ME I HIRED A CAB AND DROVE OUT TO THE ROCKERBILT MANSION SENT IN WORD THAT MISTER DE PELT'S MAN WAS WAITING FOR HIM
479-107480-0006 I TOOK HIM TO HIS APARTMENT DISMISSED THE CAB AND LETTING OURSELVES INTO HIS ROOM WITH HIS OWN LATCH KEY PUT HIM TO BED HIS CLOTHES I TOOK AS A WELL ORDERED VALET SHOULD FROM HIS BED CHAMBER INTO AN ADJOINING ROOM WHERE AFTER REMOVING THE CONTENTS OF HIS POCKETS
479-107480-0007 I HUNG THEM NEATLY OVER A CHAIR AND DEPARTED TAKING WITH ME OF COURSE EVERYTHING OF VALUE THE YOUNG GENTLEMAN HAD ABOUT HIM EVEN DOWN TO THE TWO BRILLIANT RUBIES HE WORE IN HIS GARTER BUCKLES THIS CONSISTED OF TWO HANDFULS OF CRUMPLED TWENTY DOLLAR BILLS FROM HIS TROUSERS
479-107480-0008 THREE ROLLS OF ONE HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS FROM HIS WAISTCOAT AND SUNDRY OTHER LOTS OF CURRENCY BOTH PAPER AND SPECIE THAT I FOUND STOWED AWAY IN HIS OVERCOAT AND DINNER COAT POCKETS THERE WERE ALSO TEN TWENTY DOLLAR GOLD PIECES IN A LITTLE SILVER CHAIN BAG HE CARRIED ON HIS WRIST
