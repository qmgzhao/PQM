479-107479-0000 I WAS INSTALLED AT BOLIVAR LODGE AS HEAD BUTLER AND STEWARD MY SALARY TO CONSIST OF WHAT I COULD MAKE OUT OF IT ON THE SIDE
479-107479-0001 FROM VARIOUS TRADESMEN OF THE TOWN I RECEIVED PRESENTS OF NO LITTLE VALUE IN THE FORM SOMETIMES OF DIAMOND SCARF PINS GOLD LINK SLEEVE BUTTONS CASES OF FINE WINES FOR MY OWN USE AND IN ONE OR TWO INSTANCES CHECKS OF SUBSTANTIAL VALUE
479-107479-0002 THERE WAS ALSO WHAT WAS CALLED A STEWARD'S REBATE ON THE MONTHLY BILLS WHICH IN CIRCLES WHERE LAVISH ENTERTAINMENT IS THE ORDER OF THE DAY AMOUNTED TO A TIDY LITTLE INCOME IN ITSELF
479-107479-0003 WITH WHOM I WAS PERFORCE REQUIRED TO ASSOCIATE THIS WENT VERY MUCH AGAINST THE GRAIN AT FIRST FOR
479-107479-0004 AND STILL RETAIN THE PREJUDICE AGAINST INFERIOR ASSOCIATIONS WHICH AN ENGLISH GENTLEMAN WHATEVER THE VICISSITUDES OF HIS CAREER CAN NEVER QUITE RID HIMSELF OF I HAD TO JOIN THEIR CLUB AN EXCLUSIVE ORGANIZATION OF BUTLERS AND GENTLEMEN'S GENTLEMEN OTHERWISE VALETS
479-107479-0005 AND IN ORDER TO QUIET ALL SUSPICION OF MY REAL STATUS IN THE VAN RAFFLES HOUSEHOLD I WAS COMPELLED TO ACT THE PART IN A FASHION WHICH REVOLTED ME OTHERWISE THE POSITION WAS PLEASANT AND
479-107479-0006 IT DID NOT TAKE ME MANY DAYS TO DISCOVER THAT HENRIETTE WAS A WORTHY SUCCESSOR TO HER LATE HUSBAND FEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR PERSONAL PROFIT ESCAPED HER EYE AND I WAS ABLE TO OBSERVE AS TIME WENT ON AND I NOTED THE ACCUMULATION OF SPOONS FORKS NUTCRACKERS
479-107479-0007 AND GIMCRACKS GENERALLY THAT SHE BROUGHT HOME WITH HER AFTER HER CALLS UPON OR DINNERS WITH LADIES OF FASHION THAT SHE HAD THAT QUALITY OF TRUE GENIUS WHICH NEVER OVERLOOKS THE SMALLEST DETAILS THE FIRST BIG COUP AFTER MY ARRIVAL AS THE RESULT OF HER GENIUS
479-107479-0008 AND IT HAS AFFECTED HER USUAL CALMNESS I MUST DO SOMETHING TO WARN HER AGAINST THIS MOMENTARY WEAKNESS
479-107479-0009 THIS WON'T DO HENRIETTE NERVES WILL PROVE YOUR RUIN AND IF YOU CAN'T STAND YOUR LOSSES AT BRIDGE WHAT WILL YOU DO IN THE FACE OF THE GREATER CRISIS WHICH IN OUR PROFESSION IS LIKELY TO CONFRONT US IN THE SHAPE OF AN UNEXPECTED VISIT OF POLICE AT ANY MOMENT HER ANSWER WAS A RINGING LAUGH
479-107479-0010 WHY MY DEAR BUNNY I LOST THAT MONEY ON PURPOSE
479-107479-0011 FOR THE GOOD OF OUR CAUSE IT IS MY TASK TO LOSE STEADILY AND WITH GOOD GRACE THIS ESTABLISHES MY CREDIT PROVES MY AMIABILITY AND CONFIRMS MY POPULARITY
479-107479-0012 NO DETECTIVES I HOPE I REPLIED PALING AT THE THOUGHT NO SIR SHE LAUGHED MISSUS GASTER'S MAID WE MUST GET HER BUNNY
479-107479-0013 BY GETTING IN HER FINE WORK AHEAD OF HIS EXPLAINED HENRIETTE HE POINTED HER OUT TO ME IN PICCADILLY ONCE AND I HAVE NEVER FORGOTTEN HER FACE I HOPE SHE DID NOT RECOGNIZE YOU I OBSERVED
479-107479-0014 BUT I KNEW HER THE MINUTE SHE TOOK MY CLOAK SAID HENRIETTE SHE'S DYED HER HAIR
479-107479-0015 ONE OF HER FASCINATIONS REMAINED UNCHANGED
479-107479-0016 WHEN I GOT THE CLOAK BACK BOTH WERE GONE OH SHE'S FIAMETTA DE BELLEVILLE ALL RIGHT AND WE MUST GET HER WHAT FOR TO ROB YOU
479-107479-0017 BUT THERE THERE BUNNY I'LL MANAGE THIS LITTLE THING MYSELF IT'S A TRIFLE TOO SUBTLE FOR A MAN'S INTELLECT ESPECIALLY WHEN THAT MAN IS YOU
479-107479-0018 HUMPH I SAID GLOOMILY THAT CUTS US OUT DOESN'T IT DOES IT
479-107479-0019 OF THE MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCE OF MISSUS GASTER'S JEWELS
479-107479-0020 SHE'LL SKIP NOW SAID I NOT SHE SAID HENRIETTE TO DISAPPEAR NOW WOULD BE A CONFESSION OF GUILT IF FIAMETTA DE BELLEVILLE IS THE WOMAN I TAKE HER FOR
479-107479-0021 WHERE THEN I ASKED WITH MISSUS A J VAN RAFFLES REPLIED HENRIETTE THE FACT IS SHE ADDED I HAVE ALREADY ENGAGED HER SHE HAS ACTED HER PART WELL
479-107479-0022 THAT EVEN MISSUS GASTER IS DISTURBED OVER HER CONDITION
479-107479-0023 I COULDN'T MADAM SHE SAID WHEN MISSUS GASTER ASKED HER TO STAY
479-107479-0024 AND I'D RATHER WORK IN A FACTORY OR BECOME A SHOP GIRL IN A DEPARTMENT STORE

479-107479-0026 PLEASE REMEMBER THAT I WARNED YOU AGAINST THIS FOOLISH ACT ALL RIGHT BUNNY I'LL REMEMBER SMILED MISSUS VAN RAFFLES AND THERE THE MATTER WAS DROPPED FOR THE MOMENT
479-107479-0027 AS THE MAID OF MISSUS A J VAN RAFFLES TO HER EAGLE EYE IT WAS ANOTHER PROMISING FIELD FOR PROFIT FOR HENRIETTE HAD SPARED NEITHER PAINS NOR MONEY TO IMPRESS FIAMETTA WITH THE IDEA THAT NEXT TO MISSUS GASTER SHE WAS ABOUT AS LAVISH AND FINANCIALLY CAPABLE A HOUSEHOLDER
479-107479-0028 AS COULD BE FOUND IN THE SOCIAL CAPITAL OF THE UNITED STATES AS FOR ME I WAS THE PICTURE OF GLOOM
479-107479-0029 RAFFLES RANG HURRIEDLY FOR ME YES MADAM I SAID RESPONDING IMMEDIATELY TO HER CALL BUNNY SHE SAID HER HAND TREMBLING A LITTLE THE HOUR FOR ACTION HAS ARRIVED

479-107479-0032 I FOLLOWED OUT HENRIETTE'S INSTRUCTIONS TO THE LETTER AND AN HOUR LATER RETURNED WITH THE INFORMATION THAT FIAMETTA WAS INDEED SAFELY ON HER WAY GOOD SAID MISSUS RAFFLES AND NOW BUNNY FOR THE GASTER JEWELS MOUNTING THE STAIRS RAPIDLY TAKING CARE OF COURSE
479-107479-0033 AND THEN BACK TO ENGLAND FOR FIAMETTA
479-107480-0000 THE PEARL ROPE OF MISSUS GUSHINGTON ANDREWS BUNNY SAID HENRIETTA ONE MORNING

479-107480-0003 AND THEN I UNFOLDED TO HER THE INCIDENTS OF THE NIGHT BEFORE WHEN BY ASSUMING AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE THE POSITION OF VALET
479-107480-0004 WHEN WORD CAME OVER THE TELEPHONE TO DIGBY MISTER DE PELT'S VALET THAT MISTER DE PELT WAS AT THE ROCKERBILTS AND IN NO CONDITION TO GO HOME ALONE IT HAPPENED THAT IT WAS I WHO TOOK THE MESSAGE AND OBSERVING THAT DIGBY WAS ENGAGED IN A GAME OF BILLIARDS AND LIKELY TO REMAIN SO FOR SOME TIME TO COME
479-107480-0005 I DECIDED TO GO AFTER THE GENTLEMAN MYSELF WITHOUT SAYING ANYTHING TO DIGBY ABOUT IT MUFFLING MYSELF UP SO THAT NO ONE COULD RECOGNIZE ME I HIRED A CAB AND DROVE OUT TO THE ROCKERBILT MANSION SENT IN WORD THAT MISTER DE PELT'S MAN WAS WAITING FOR HIM
479-107480-0006 I TOOK HIM TO HIS APARTMENT DISMISSED THE CAB AND LETTING OURSELVES INTO HIS ROOM WITH HIS OWN LATCH KEY PUT HIM TO BED HIS CLOTHES I TOOK AS A WELL ORDERED VALET SHOULD FROM HIS BED CHAMBER INTO AN ADJOINING ROOM WHERE AFTER REMOVING THE CONTENTS OF HIS POCKETS
479-107480-0007 I HUNG THEM NEATLY OVER A CHAIR AND DEPARTED TAKING WITH ME OF COURSE EVERYTHING OF VALUE THE YOUNG GENTLEMAN HAD ABOUT HIM EVEN DOWN TO THE TWO BRILLIANT RUBIES HE WORE IN HIS GARTER BUCKLES THIS CONSISTED OF TWO HANDFULS OF CRUMPLED TWENTY DOLLAR BILLS FROM HIS TROUSERS
479-107480-0008 THREE ROLLS OF ONE HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS FROM HIS WAISTCOAT AND SUNDRY OTHER LOTS OF CURRENCY BOTH PAPER AND SPECIE THAT I FOUND STOWED AWAY IN HIS OVERCOAT AND DINNER COAT POCKETS THERE WERE ALSO TEN TWENTY DOLLAR GOLD PIECES IN A LITTLE SILVER CHAIN BAG HE CARRIED ON HIS WRIST

479-107480-0011 THERE WASN'T ANYTHING HE WOULDN'T DO FOR ME
479-107480-0012 AGAIN I LAUGHED HE WON'T SAID I WITH A CONVICTION BORN OF EXPERIENCE

479-107480-0023 THAT EVEN IF SO LITTLE AS ONE OF THESE FASTENED ITS TALONS UPON THE PEARL ROPE OF MISSUS GUSHINGTON ANDREWS NOTHING UNDER HEAVEN COULD SAVE IT FROM LACERATION WHAT A MARVELLOUS MIND THERE LAY BEHIND THOSE EXQUISITE CHILDLIKE EYES OF THE WONDERFUL HENRIETTE

479-126480-0001 I THANK YOU KINDLY LITTLE DOG I FARE AS WELL AS YOU OLD RHYME ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS A PUSSY CAT CALLED RIBBY WHO INVITED A LITTLE DOG CALLED DUCHESS TO TEA COME IN GOOD TIME MY DEAR DUCHESS SAID RIBBY'S LETTER

479-126480-0003 AND THEN SHE THOUGHT THAT DID NOT LOOK QUITE POLITE
479-126480-0004 AND SHE GAVE HER LETTER TO THE POSTMAN BUT SHE THOUGHT A GREAT DEAL ABOUT RIBBY'S PIE
479-126480-0005 I REALLY COULDN'T COULDN'T EAT MOUSE PIE AND I SHALL HAVE TO EAT IT BECAUSE IT IS A PARTY AND MY PIE WAS GOING TO BE VEAL AND HAM A PINK AND WHITE PIE DISH AND SO IS MINE JUST LIKE RIBBY'S DISHES THEY WERE BOTH BOUGHT AT TABITHA TWITCHIT'S
479-126480-0006 SHE POPPED HER PIE INTO THE OVEN THERE WERE TWO OVENS ONE ABOVE THE OTHER SOME OTHER KNOBS AND HANDLES WERE ONLY ORNAMENTAL AND NOT INTENDED TO OPEN
479-126480-0007 THE TOP OVEN BAKES TOO QUICKLY SAID RIBBY TO HERSELF
479-126480-0008 THEN SHE WENT OUT WITH A CAN TO THE WELL FOR WATER TO FILL UP THE KETTLE THEN SHE BEGAN TO SET THE ROOM IN ORDER FOR IT WAS THE SITTING ROOM AS WELL AS THE KITCHEN WHEN RIBBY HAD LAID THE TABLE SHE WENT OUT DOWN THE FIELD TO THE FARM TO FETCH MILK AND BUTTER
479-126480-0009 WHEN SHE CAME BACK SHE PEEPED INTO THE BOTTOM OVEN THE PIE LOOKED VERY COMFORTABLE RIBBY PUT ON HER SHAWL AND BONNET AND WENT OUT AGAIN WITH A BASKET TO THE VILLAGE SHOP TO BUY A PACKET OF TEA A POUND OF LUMP SUGAR AND A POT OF MARMALADE
479-126480-0010 AND JUST AT THE SAME TIME DUCHESS CAME OUT OF HER HOUSE AT THE OTHER END OF THE VILLAGE RIBBY MET DUCHESS HALF WAY DOWN THE STREET ALSO CARRYING A BASKET COVERED WITH A CLOTH THEY ONLY BOWED TO ONE ANOTHER THEY DID NOT SPEAK BECAUSE THEY WERE GOING TO HAVE A PARTY
479-126480-0011 AS SOON AS DUCHESS HAD GOT ROUND THE CORNER OUT OF SIGHT SHE SIMPLY RAN STRAIGHT AWAY TO RIBBY'S HOUSE RIBBY WENT INTO THE SHOP AND BOUGHT WHAT
479-126480-0012 RIBBY WENT ON TO TIMOTHY BAKER'S AND BOUGHT THE MUFFINS THEN SHE WENT HOME THERE SEEMED TO BE A SORT OF SCUFFLING NOISE IN THE BACK PASSAGE AS SHE WAS COMING IN AT THE FRONT DOOR BUT THERE WAS NOBODY THERE
479-126480-0013 IT IS A VERY ODD THING THAT RIBBY'S PIE WAS NOT IN THE OVEN WHEN I PUT MINE IN AND I CAN'T FIND IT ANYWHERE I HAVE LOOKED ALL OVER THE HOUSE I PUT MY PIE INTO A NICE HOT OVEN AT THE TOP I COULD NOT TURN ANY OF THE OTHER HANDLES
479-126480-0014 DUCHESS WENT HOME AND BRUSHED HER BEAUTIFUL BLACK COAT AND THEN SHE PICKED A BUNCH OF FLOWERS IN HER GARDEN AS A PRESENT FOR RIBBY AND PASSED THE TIME UNTIL THE CLOCK STRUCK FOUR
479-126480-0015 SHE SAT DOWN BEFORE THE FIRE TO WAIT FOR THE LITTLE DOG
479-126480-0016 VERY PUNCTUALLY AT FOUR O'CLOCK DUCHESS STARTED TO GO TO THE PARTY
479-126480-0017 JUST A SHADE LONGER I WILL POUR OUT THE TEA WHILE WE WAIT
479-126480-0018 SHE DROPPED THE SUGAR IN CONFUSION AND HAD TO GO HUNTING UNDER THE TEA TABLE SO DID NOT SEE WHICH OVEN RIBBY OPENED IN ORDER TO GET OUT THE PIE RIBBY SET THE PIE UPON THE TABLE THERE WAS A VERY SAVOURY SMELL DUCHESS CAME OUT FROM UNDER THE TABLE CLOTH MUNCHING SUGAR AND SAT UP ON A CHAIR
479-126480-0019 I THINK THOUGHT DUCHESS TO HERSELF I THINK IT WOULD BE WISER IF I HELPED MYSELF TO PIE
479-126480-0020 I DID NOT REMEMBER THAT I HAD MINCED IT UP SO FINE I SUPPOSE THIS IS A QUICKER OVEN THAN MY OWN THE PIE DISH WAS EMPTYING RAPIDLY DUCHESS HAD HAD FOUR HELPS ALREADY AND WAS FUMBLING WITH THE SPOON
