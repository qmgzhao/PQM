3389-13248-0014 HE WAS SIMPLY DOING WHAT EVERY OTHER BUSINESS MAN IN RAYMOND DID AND IT WAS ONE OF THE BEST PAYING SOURCES OF REVENUE WHAT WOULD THE PAPER DO IF IT CUT THESE OUT COULD IT LIVE THAT WAS THE QUESTION BUT WAS THAT THE QUESTION AFTER ALL WHAT WOULD JESUS DO THAT WAS THE QUESTION HE WAS ANSWERING OR TRYING TO ANSWER THIS WEEK
3389-13248-0015 WOULD JESUS ADVERTISE WHISKEY AND TOBACCO IN HIS PAPER
3389-13248-0016 HE HANDED THE PAPER WITH THE MARKED PLACES OVER TO CLARK
3389-13248-0017 CLARK DO YOU THINK IF JESUS WAS THE EDITOR AND PROPRIETOR OF A DAILY PAPER IN RAYMOND HE WOULD PERMIT ADVERTISEMENTS OF WHISKEY AND TOBACCO IN IT
3389-13248-0018 WE SHALL CERTAINLY BANKRUPT THE PAPER WITH THIS SORT OF BUSINESS POLICY DO YOU THINK SO NORMAN ASKED THE QUESTION NOT AS IF HE EXPECTED AN ANSWER BUT SIMPLY AS IF HE WERE TALKING WITH HIMSELF AFTER A PAUSE HE SAID YOU MAY DIRECT MARKS TO DO AS I HAVE SAID I BELIEVE IT IS WHAT CHRIST WOULD DO AND AS I TOLD YOU CLARK
3389-13248-0019 I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT BY ANY KIND OF REASONING WE COULD REACH A CONCLUSION JUSTIFYING OUR LORD IN THE ADVERTISEMENT
3389-13248-0020 HE COULD NOT GRASP THE MEANING OF IT ALL HE FELT ENRAGED AND ALARMED HE WAS SURE ANY SUCH POLICY WOULD RUIN THE PAPER AS SOON AS IT BECAME GENERALLY KNOWN THAT THE EDITOR WAS TRYING TO DO EVERYTHING BY SUCH AN ABSURD MORAL STANDARD WHAT WOULD BECOME OF BUSINESS IF THIS STANDARD WAS ADOPTED
3389-13248-0021 IT WOULD UPSET EVERY CUSTOM AND INTRODUCE ENDLESS CONFUSION IT WAS SIMPLY FOOLISHNESS IT WAS DOWNRIGHT IDIOCY
3389-13248-0022 WHAT WAS THE MATTER WITH THE CHIEF WAS HE INSANE WAS HE GOING TO BANKRUPT THE WHOLE BUSINESS BUT EDWARD NORMAN HAD NOT YET FACED HIS MOST SERIOUS PROBLEM WHEN HE CAME DOWN TO THE OFFICE FRIDAY MORNING HE WAS CONFRONTED WITH THE USUAL PROGRAM FOR THE SUNDAY MORNING EDITION
3389-13248-0023 LITERARY AND RELIGIOUS ITEMS TO THIRTY OR FORTY PAGES OF SPORT THEATRE GOSSIP FASHION SOCIETY AND POLITICAL MATERIAL THIS MADE A VERY INTERESTING MAGAZINE OF ALL SORTS OF READING MATTER AND HAD ALWAYS BEEN WELCOMED BY ALL THE SUBSCRIBERS CHURCH MEMBERS AND ALL AS A SUNDAY MORNING NECESSITY
3389-13248-0024 AND THE WORKING MAN ESPECIALLY WHO WOULD NOT GO TO CHURCH ANY WAY
3389-13248-0025 EDWARD NORMAN COMMUNED HONESTLY WITH HIMSELF OVER THE SUBJECT TAKING EVERYTHING INTO ACCOUNT WOULD JESUS PROBABLY EDIT A SUNDAY MORNING PAPER NO MATTER WHETHER IT PAID THAT WAS NOT THE QUESTION
3389-13248-0026 BESIDES THE REGULAR SUBSCRIBERS HAD PAID FOR A SEVEN DAY PAPER
3389-13248-0027 HE WAS HONESTLY PERPLEXED BY THE QUESTION
3389-13248-0028 IT WAS A VERY UNUSUAL PROCEEDING BUT THEY ALL AGREED THAT THE PAPER WAS BEING RUN ON NEW PRINCIPLES ANYHOW AND THEY ALL WATCHED MISTER NORMAN CAREFULLY AS HE SPOKE
3389-13248-0029 I PROPOSE CERTAIN CHANGES WHICH I BELIEVE ARE NECESSARY
3389-13248-0030 I WISH TO STATE MY MOTIVE IN DOING WHAT I HAVE DONE
3389-13248-0031 I SHALL STATE IN THAT ISSUE MY REASONS FOR DISCONTINUING IN ORDER TO MAKE UP TO THE SUBSCRIBERS THE AMOUNT OF READING MATTER THEY MAY SUPPOSE THEMSELVES ENTITLED TO WE CAN ISSUE A DOUBLE NUMBER ON SATURDAY AS IS DONE BY MANY EVENING PAPERS THAT MAKE NO ATTEMPT AT A SUNDAY EDITION
3389-13248-0032 HAS BEEN DONE BY OUR SUNDAY MORNING PAPER I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT JESUS WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR IT IF HE WERE IN MY PLACE TODAY IT WILL OCCASION SOME TROUBLE TO ARRANGE THE DETAILS CAUSED BY THIS CHANGE WITH THE ADVERTISERS AND SUBSCRIBERS THAT IS FOR ME TO LOOK AFTER THE CHANGE ITSELF IS ONE THAT WILL TAKE PLACE
3389-13248-0033 SO FAR AS I CAN SEE THE LOSS WILL FALL ON MYSELF NEITHER THE REPORTERS NOR THE PRESSMEN NEED MAKE ANY PARTICULAR CHANGES IN THEIR PLANS HE LOOKED AROUND THE ROOM AND NO ONE SPOKE
3389-13248-0034 WOULD JESUS DO THAT THAT IS WOULD HE PROBABLY RUN A NEWSPAPER ON SOME LOVING FAMILY PLAN
3389-13248-0035 HE CAUGHT HIMSELF DRAWING ALMOST AWAY FROM THE FACTS OF TYPOGRAPHICAL UNIONS AND
3389-13248-0036 AND ALL THE COLD BUSINESSLIKE METHODS THAT MAKE A GREAT DAILY SUCCESSFUL
3389-13248-0037 CLARK WAS A VERY VALUABLE MAN IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO FILL HIS PLACE BUT HE WAS NOT ABLE TO GIVE ANY REASONS FOR CONTINUING THE SUNDAY PAPER THAT ANSWERED THE QUESTION WHAT WOULD JESUS DO BY LETTING JESUS PRINT THAT EDITION
3389-13248-0038 WE MIGHT AS WELL FACE THAT FUTURE FACT I DON'T THINK WE SHALL WILL YOU STAY BY THE NEWS UNTIL IT IS BANKRUPT ASKED NORMAN WITH A STRANGE SMILE
3389-13250-0000 AND BRETHREN AND SISTERS YEA AND HIS OWN LIFE ALSO HE CANNOT BE MY DISCIPLE AND WHOSOEVER FORSAKETH NOT ALL THAT HE HATH HE CANNOT BE MY DISCIPLE
3389-13250-0001 WHEN RACHEL WINSLOW AND VIRGINIA PAGE SEPARATED AFTER THE MEETING AT THE FIRST CHURCH ON SUNDAY THEY AGREED TO CONTINUE THEIR CONVERSATION THE NEXT DAY VIRGINIA ASKED RACHEL TO COME AND LUNCH WITH HER AT NOON
3389-13250-0002 AND RACHEL ACCORDINGLY RANG THE BELL AT THE PAGE MANSION ABOUT HALF PAST ELEVEN VIRGINIA HERSELF MET HER AND THE TWO WERE SOON TALKING EARNESTLY
3389-13250-0003 I CANNOT RECONCILE IT WITH MY JUDGMENT OF WHAT CHRIST WOULD DO I CANNOT TELL ANOTHER PERSON WHAT TO DO BUT I FEEL THAT I OUGHT NOT TO ACCEPT THIS OFFER WHAT WILL YOU DO THEN ASKED VIRGINIA WITH GREAT INTEREST
3389-13250-0004 RACHEL PICKED UP A LETTER THAT HAD BEEN LYING IN HER LAP AND RAN OVER ITS CONTENTS AGAIN IT WAS A LETTER FROM THE MANAGER OF A COMIC OPERA OFFERING HER A PLACE WITH A LARGE TRAVELING COMPANY OF THE SEASON THE SALARY WAS A VERY LARGE FIGURE
3389-13250-0005 THERE'S NO GREAT VIRTUE IN SAYING NO TO THIS OFFER WHEN I HAVE THE OTHER ONE RACHEL WENT ON THOUGHTFULLY THAT'S HARDER TO DECIDE BUT I'VE ABOUT MADE UP MY MIND TO TELL THE TRUTH VIRGINIA I'M COMPLETELY CONVINCED IN THE FIRST CASE
3389-13250-0006 THAT JESUS WOULD NEVER USE ANY TALENT LIKE A GOOD VOICE JUST TO MAKE MONEY BUT NOW TAKE THIS CONCERT OFFER HERE IS A REPUTABLE COMPANY TO TRAVEL WITH AN IMPERSONATOR AND A VIOLINIST AND A MALE QUARTET ALL PEOPLE OF GOOD REPUTATION
3389-13250-0007 I'M ASKED TO GO AS ONE OF THE COMPANY AND SING LEADING SOPRANO THE SALARY I MENTIONED IT DIDN'T I IS GUARANTEED TO BE TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH FOR THE SEASON BUT I DON'T FEEL SATISFIED THAT JESUS WOULD GO WHAT DO YOU THINK
3389-13250-0008 I BELIEVE MISTER MAXWELL WAS RIGHT
3389-13250-0009 I AM HAVING A HARDER TIME THAN YOU ARE DEAR TO DECIDE WHAT HE WOULD DO ARE YOU RACHEL ASKED
3389-13250-0010 VIRGINIA CAME AND STOOD BY HER
3389-13250-0011 AND THE TWO YOUNG WOMEN LOOKED AT IT SILENTLY FOR A MOMENT SUDDENLY VIRGINIA BROKE OUT AS RACHEL HAD NEVER HEARD HER BEFORE RACHEL
3389-13250-0012 AND OCCASIONALLY TO EASE ITS CONSCIENCE DONATING WITHOUT ANY PERSONAL SACRIFICE A LITTLE MONEY TO CHARITY
3389-13250-0013 LAUNCHED INTO SOCIETY AS AN HEIRESS SUPPOSED TO BE IN A VERY ENVIABLE POSITION I'M PERFECTLY WELL I CAN TRAVEL OR STAY AT HOME I CAN DO AS I PLEASE I CAN GRATIFY ALMOST ANY WANT OR DESIRE AND YET WHEN I HONESTLY TRY TO IMAGINE
3389-13250-0014 I HAVE NOT LOOKED OUT OF THIS WINDOW FOR WEEKS WITHOUT A FEELING OF HORROR TOWARD MYSELF AS I SEE THE HUMANITY THAT PASSES BY THIS HOUSE VIRGINIA TURNED AWAY AND WALKED UP AND DOWN THE ROOM RACHEL WATCHED HER AND COULD NOT REPRESS THE RISING TIDE OF HER OWN GROWING DEFINITION OF DISCIPLESHIP
3389-13250-0015 OF WHAT CHRISTIAN USE WAS HER OWN TALENT OF SONG WAS THE BEST SHE COULD DO TO SELL HER TALENT FOR SO MUCH A MONTH GO ON A CONCERT COMPANY'S TOUR DRESS BEAUTIFULLY ENJOY THE EXCITEMENT OF PUBLIC APPLAUSE AND GAIN A REPUTATION AS A GREAT SINGER
3389-13250-0016 WAS THAT WHAT JESUS WOULD DO SHE WAS NOT MORBID
3389-13250-0017 AND KNEW THAT IF SHE WENT OUT INTO PUBLIC LIFE SHE COULD MAKE A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY AND BECOME WELL KNOWN
3389-13250-0018 WHAT SHE HAD JUST SAID SMOTE RACHEL WITH GREAT FORCE BECAUSE OF THE SIMILAR POSITION IN WHICH THE TWO FRIENDS FOUND THEMSELVES LUNCH WAS ANNOUNCED AND THEY WENT OUT AND WERE JOINED BY VIRGINIA'S GRANDMOTHER MADAM PAGE A HANDSOME STATELY WOMAN OF SIXTY FIVE
3389-13250-0019 AND VIRGINIA'S BROTHER ROLLIN A YOUNG MAN WHO SPENT MOST OF HIS TIME AT ONE OF THE CLUBS AND HAD NO AMBITION FOR ANYTHING BUT A GROWING ADMIRATION FOR RACHEL WINSLOW
3389-13250-0020 THESE THREE MADE UP THE PAGE FAMILY VIRGINIA'S FATHER HAD BEEN A BANKER AND GRAIN SPECULATOR HER MOTHER HAD DIED TEN YEARS BEFORE HER FATHER WITHIN THE PAST YEAR
3389-13250-0021 OF WEALTH AND SOCIAL STANDING THAT HAVE NEVER BEEN DISTURBED SHE WAS A SHREWD CAREFUL BUSINESS WOMAN OF MORE THAN AVERAGE ABILITY
3389-13250-0022 VIRGINIA'S PORTION WAS WITHOUT ANY RESTRICTION HER OWN SHE HAD BEEN TRAINED BY HER FATHER TO UNDERSTAND THE WAYS OF THE BUSINESS WORLD AND EVEN THE GRANDMOTHER HAD BEEN COMPELLED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE GIRL'S CAPACITY FOR TAKING CARE OF HER OWN MONEY
3389-13250-0023 THAN MADAM PAGE AND ROLLIN RACHEL WHO HAD KNOWN THE FAMILY SINCE SHE WAS A GIRL PLAYMATE OF VIRGINIA'S COULD NOT HELP THINKING OF WHAT CONFRONTED VIRGINIA IN HER OWN HOME WHEN SHE ONCE DECIDED ON THE COURSE WHICH SHE HONESTLY BELIEVED JESUS WOULD TAKE
3389-13250-0024 TODAY AT LUNCH AS SHE RECALLED VIRGINIA'S OUTBREAK IN THE FRONT ROOM SHE TRIED TO PICTURE THE SCENE THAT WOULD AT SOME TIME OCCUR BETWEEN MADAM PAGE AND HER GRANDDAUGHTER I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU ARE GOING ON THE STAGE MISS WINSLOW WE SHALL ALL BE DELIGHTED I'M SURE SAID ROLLIN DURING THE CONVERSATION
3389-13250-0025 WHICH HAD NOT BEEN VERY ANIMATED RACHEL COLORED AND FELT ANNOYED WHO TOLD YOU SHE ASKED
3389-13250-0026 YOU'RE MISTAKEN I'M NOT GOING ON THE STAGE IT'S A GREAT PITY YOU'D MAKE A HIT EVERYBODY IS TALKING ABOUT YOUR SINGING THIS TIME RACHEL FLUSHED WITH GENUINE ANGER BEFORE SHE COULD SAY ANYTHING VIRGINIA BROKE IN WHOM DO YOU MEAN BY EVERYBODY
3389-13250-0027 WHAT OTHER TIME DO THEY HEAR HER IT'S A GREAT PITY I SAY THAT THE GENERAL PUBLIC OUTSIDE OF RAYMOND CANNOT HEAR HER VOICE LET US TALK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE SAID RACHEL A LITTLE SHARPLY MADAM PAGE GLANCED AT HER AND SPOKE WITH A GENTLE COURTESY MY DEAR ROLLIN NEVER COULD
3389-13250-0028 PAY AN INDIRECT COMPLIMENT HE IS LIKE HIS FATHER IN THAT BUT WE ARE ALL CURIOUS TO KNOW SOMETHING OF YOUR PLANS WE CLAIM THE RIGHT FROM OLD ACQUAINTANCE YOU KNOW AND VIRGINIA HAS ALREADY TOLD US OF YOUR CONCERT COMPANY OFFER
3389-13250-0029 I SUPPOSED OF COURSE THAT WAS PUBLIC PROPERTY SAID VIRGINIA SMILING ACROSS THE TABLE I WAS IN THE NEWS OFFICE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY YES YES REPLIED RACHEL HASTILY I UNDERSTAND THAT MADAM PAGE
3389-13250-0030 CONCERNING THE CONCERT COMPANY'S OFFER
3389-13250-0031 SOMEHOW WHAT ROLLIN PAGE HAD SAID AND HIS MANNER IN SAYING IT HAD HASTENED HER DECISION IN THE MATTER WOULD YOU MIND TELLING US RACHEL YOUR REASONS FOR REFUSING THE OFFER
3389-13250-0032 DON'T YOU THINK THE GENERAL PUBLIC OUGHT TO HEAR YOU
3389-13250-0033 SHE SPOKE NOW IN REPLY TO MADAM PAGE IN ONE OF THOSE RARE MOMENTS OF UNRESERVE THAT ADDED TO THE ATTRACTIVENESS OF HER WHOLE CHARACTER
3389-13250-0034 LOOKING INTO MADAM PAGE'S EYES WITH A CLEAR EARNEST GAZE MADAM PAGE TURNED RED AND ROLLIN STARED BEFORE HER GRANDMOTHER COULD SAY ANYTHING VIRGINIA SPOKE HER RISING COLOR SHOWED HOW SHE WAS STIRRED VIRGINIA'S PALE CLEAR COMPLEXION WAS THAT OF HEALTH
3389-13250-0035 MISTER MAXWELL'S PROPOSITION WAS PLAIN TO ALL WHO HEARD IT WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO ARRIVE AT OUR DECISIONS VERY RAPIDLY
3389-13250-0036 MADAM PAGE LOOKED SHARPLY AT VIRGINIA BEFORE SHE SAID ANYTHING OF COURSE I UNDERSTAND MISTER MAXWELL'S STATEMENT
3389-13250-0037 I HAVE NOTHING TO SAY ABOUT MISS WINSLOW'S AFFAIRS BUT
3389-13250-0038 I HOPE YOU HAVE NO FOOLISH NOTIONS IN THIS MATTER VIRGINIA I HAVE A GREAT MANY NOTIONS REPLIED VIRGINIA QUIETLY WHETHER THEY ARE FOOLISH OR NOT DEPENDS UPON MY RIGHT UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT HE WOULD DO AS SOON AS I FIND OUT I SHALL DO IT
3389-13250-0039 EXCUSE ME LADIES SAID ROLLIN RISING FROM THE TABLE THE CONVERSATION IS GETTING BEYOND MY DEPTH
3389-13250-0040 MADAM PAGE WAITED UNTIL THE SERVANT HAD BROUGHT IN SOMETHING AND THEN ASKED HER TO GO OUT
3389-13250-0041 I AM OLDER BY SEVERAL YEARS THAN YOU YOUNG LADIES SHE SAID AND HER TRADITIONAL TYPE OF BEARING SEEMED TO RACHEL TO RISE UP LIKE A GREAT FROZEN WALL BETWEEN HER AND EVERY CONCEPTION OF JESUS AS A SACRIFICE WHAT YOU HAVE PROMISED IN A SPIRIT OF FALSE EMOTION I PRESUME IS IMPOSSIBLE OF PERFORMANCE
3389-13250-0042 DO YOU MEAN GRANDMOTHER THAT WE CANNOT POSSIBLY ACT AS OUR LORD WOULD
3389-13250-0043 BESIDES HOW CAN YOU ACT WITH ANY MADAM PAGE PAUSED BROKE OFF HER SENTENCE AND THEN TURNED TO RACHEL WHAT WILL YOUR MOTHER SAY TO YOUR DECISION MY DEAR IS IT NOT FOOLISH
3389-13250-0044 MISSUS WINSLOW WAS THAT WOMAN OH
