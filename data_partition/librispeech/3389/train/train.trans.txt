3389-130127-0028 THERE PASSEPARTOUT BEHELD BEAUTIFUL FIR AND CEDAR GROVES SACRED GATES OF A SINGULAR ARCHITECTURE BRIDGES HALF HID IN THE MIDST OF BAMBOOS AND REEDS TEMPLES SHADED BY IMMENSE CEDAR TREES HOLY RETREATS
3389-130127-0029 AND INTERMINABLE STREETS WHERE A PERFECT HARVEST OF ROSE TINTED AND RED CHEEKED CHILDREN
3389-130127-0030 AND WHO WERE PLAYING IN THE MIDST OF SHORT LEGGED POODLES AND YELLOWISH CATS MIGHT HAVE BEEN GATHERED THE STREETS WERE CROWDED WITH PEOPLE PRIESTS WERE PASSING IN PROCESSIONS BEATING THEIR DREARY TAMBOURINES POLICE AND CUSTOM HOUSE OFFICERS WITH POINTED HATS ENCRUSTED WITH LAC AND CARRYING TWO SABRES

3389-130127-0034 BUT NEVER YELLOW LIKE THE CHINESE FROM WHOM THE JAPANESE WIDELY DIFFER
3389-130127-0035 CARRIAGES AND PALANQUINS BARROWS SUPPLIED WITH SAILS AND LITTERS MADE OF BAMBOO NOR THE WOMEN WHOM HE THOUGHT NOT ESPECIALLY HANDSOME WHO TOOK LITTLE STEPS WITH THEIR LITTLE FEET WHEREON THEY WORE CANVAS SHOES STRAW SANDALS AND CLOGS OF WORKED WOOD
3389-130127-0036 AND WHO DISPLAYED TIGHT LOOKING EYES FLAT CHESTS TEETH FASHIONABLY BLACKENED AND GOWNS CROSSED WITH SILKEN SCARFS
3389-130127-0037 LOOKING IN AT THE WINDOWS OF THE RICH AND CURIOUS SHOPS THE JEWELLERY ESTABLISHMENTS GLITTERING WITH QUAINT JAPANESE ORNAMENTS THE RESTAURANTS DECKED WITH STREAMERS AND BANNERS THE TEA HOUSES WHERE THE ODOROUS BEVERAGE WAS BEING DRUNK WITH SAKI A LIQUOR CONCOCTED FROM THE FERMENTATION OF RICE
3389-130127-0038 BUT A VERY FINE STRINGY TOBACCO HE WENT ON TILL HE FOUND HIMSELF IN THE FIELDS IN THE MIDST OF VAST RICE PLANTATIONS THERE HE SAW DAZZLING CAMELLIAS EXPANDING THEMSELVES WITH FLOWERS WHICH WERE GIVING FORTH THEIR LAST COLOURS AND PERFUMES
3389-130127-0039 NOT ON BUSHES BUT ON TREES AND WITHIN BAMBOO ENCLOSURES CHERRY PLUM AND APPLE TREES WHICH THE JAPANESE CULTIVATE RATHER FOR THEIR BLOSSOMS THAN THEIR FRUIT AND WHICH QUEERLY FASHIONED GRINNING SCARECROWS PROTECTED FROM THE SPARROWS PIGEONS RAVENS AND OTHER VORACIOUS BIRDS

3389-130127-0042 GOOD SAID HE I'LL HAVE SOME SUPPER BUT ON SMELLING THEM HE FOUND THAT THEY WERE ODOURLESS NO CHANCE THERE THOUGHT HE THE WORTHY FELLOW HAD CERTAINLY TAKEN GOOD CARE TO EAT AS HEARTY A BREAKFAST AS POSSIBLE BEFORE LEAVING THE CARNATIC
3389-130127-0043 HE MADE UP HIS MIND THAT MEAT WAS FAR FROM PLENTIFUL IN YOKOHAMA NOR WAS HE MISTAKEN AND IN DEFAULT OF BUTCHER'S MEAT
3389-130127-0044 SOME GAME OR FISH WHICH WITH RICE THE JAPANESE EAT ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY
3389-130127-0045 AND TO POSTPONE THE MEAL HE CRAVED TILL THE FOLLOWING MORNING NIGHT CAME
3389-130127-0046 WHERE HE WANDERED THROUGH THE STREETS LIT BY VARI COLOURED LANTERNS LOOKING ON AT THE DANCERS WHO WERE EXECUTING SKILFUL STEPS AND BOUNDINGS AND THE ASTROLOGERS WHO STOOD IN THE OPEN AIR WITH THEIR TELESCOPES
3389-130127-0047 THE STREETS AT LAST BECAME QUIET AND THE PATROL THE OFFICERS OF WHICH IN THEIR SPLENDID COSTUMES AND SURROUNDED BY THEIR SUITES PASSEPARTOUT THOUGHT SEEMED LIKE AMBASSADORS SUCCEEDED THE BUSTLING CROWD
3389-13247-0000 WITH HIS EYES OPEN TO ALL THE POSSIBLE RESULTS
3389-13247-0001 HE CONFRONTED IT WITH A DEGREE OF HESITATION AND A FEELING NEARLY AKIN TO FEAR HE HAD COME DOWN TO THE OFFICE VERY EARLY AND FOR A FEW MINUTES WAS BY HIMSELF HE SAT AT HIS DESK IN A GROWING THOUGHTFULNESS THAT FINALLY BECAME A DESIRE WHICH HE KNEW WAS AS GREAT AS IT WAS UNUSUAL
3389-13247-0002 HE HAD YET TO LEARN WITH ALL THE OTHERS IN THAT LITTLE COMPANY PLEDGED TO DO THE CHRISTLIKE THING THAT THE SPIRIT OF LIFE WAS MOVING IN POWER THROUGH HIS OWN LIFE AS NEVER BEFORE HE ROSE AND SHUT HIS DOOR AND THEN DID WHAT HE HAD NOT DONE FOR YEARS
3389-13247-0003 HE KNEELED DOWN BY HIS DESK AND PRAYED FOR THE DIVINE PRESENCE AND WISDOM TO DIRECT HIM HE ROSE WITH THE DAY BEFORE HIM AND HIS PROMISE DISTINCT AND CLEAR IN HIS MIND NOW FOR ACTION HE SEEMED TO SAY
3389-13247-0004 BUT HE WOULD BE LED BY EVENTS AS FAST AS THEY CAME ON HE OPENED HIS DOOR AND BEGAN THE ROUTINE OF THE OFFICE WORK
3389-13247-0005 ONE OF THE REPORTERS THERE WAS POUNDING OUT SOMETHING ON A TYPEWRITER EDWARD NORMAN BEGAN TO WRITE AN EDITORIAL THE DAILY NEWS WAS AN EVENING PAPER AND NORMAN USUALLY COMPLETED HIS LEADING EDITORIAL BEFORE NINE O'CLOCK HE HAD BEEN WRITING FOR FIFTEEN MINUTES WHEN THE MANAGING EDITOR CALLED OUT

3389-13247-0008 VERY HARD THINKING WE WON'T RUN THIS TODAY HE SAID FINALLY
3389-13247-0009 AND THOUGHT HE HAD PERHAPS MISUNDERSTOOD HIM
3389-13247-0010 LEAVE IT OUT WE WON'T USE IT BUT THE MANAGING EDITOR WAS SIMPLY DUMBFOUNDED HE STARED AT NORMAN AS IF THE MAN WAS OUT OF HIS MIND I DON'T THINK CLARK THAT IT OUGHT TO BE PRINTED AND THAT'S THE END OF IT SAID NORMAN LOOKING UP FROM HIS DESK

3389-13247-0012 THE CIRCUMSTANCES NOW HOWEVER SEEMED TO BE SO EXTRAORDINARY THAT CLARK COULD NOT HELP EXPRESSING HIMSELF
3389-13247-0013 YES THAT'S WHAT I MEAN BUT IT'S UNHEARD OF
3389-13247-0014 NORMAN LOOKED AT CLARK THOUGHTFULLY THE MANAGING EDITOR WAS A MEMBER OF A CHURCH OF A DIFFERENT DENOMINATION FROM THAT OF NORMAN'S
