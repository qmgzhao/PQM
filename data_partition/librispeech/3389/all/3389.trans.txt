3389-130127-0000 EVEN AT THE ANTIPODES IT IS CONVENIENT TO HAVE SOME MONEY IN ONE'S POCKET THE CARNATIC SETTING SAIL FROM HONG KONG AT HALF PAST SIX ON THE SEVENTH OF NOVEMBER DIRECTED HER COURSE AT FULL STEAM TOWARDS JAPAN
3389-130127-0001 SHE CARRIED A LARGE CARGO AND A WELL FILLED CABIN OF PASSENGERS TWO STATE ROOMS IN THE REAR WERE HOWEVER UNOCCUPIED THOSE WHICH HAD BEEN ENGAGED BY PHILEAS FOGG THE NEXT DAY A PASSENGER WITH A HALF STUPEFIED EYE STAGGERING GAIT
3389-130127-0002 SHORTLY AFTER FIX LEFT THE OPIUM DEN
3389-130127-0003 THE POOR FELLOW AWOKE AND STRUGGLED AGAINST THE STUPEFYING INFLUENCE OF THE NARCOTIC
3389-130127-0004 ABODE OF DRUNKENNESS STAGGERING AND HOLDING HIMSELF UP BY KEEPING AGAINST THE WALLS FALLING DOWN AND CREEPING UP AGAIN
3389-130127-0005 HE KEPT CRYING OUT THE CARNATIC THE CARNATIC
3389-130127-0006 ON THE POINT OF STARTING PASSEPARTOUT HAD BUT FEW STEPS TO GO AND RUSHING UPON THE PLANK HE CROSSED IT AND FELL UNCONSCIOUS ON THE DECK JUST AS THE CARNATIC WAS MOVING OFF
3389-130127-0007 CARRIED THE POOR FRENCHMAN DOWN INTO THE SECOND CABIN AND PASSEPARTOUT DID NOT WAKE UNTIL THEY WERE ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES AWAY FROM CHINA THUS HE FOUND HIMSELF THE NEXT MORNING ON THE DECK OF THE CARNATIC AND EAGERLY INHALING THE EXHILARATING SEA BREEZE THE PURE AIR SOBERED HIM
3389-130127-0008 HE BEGAN TO COLLECT HIS SENSE WHICH HE FOUND A DIFFICULT TASK
3389-130127-0009 FIX'S REVELATION AND THE OPIUM HOUSE
3389-130127-0010 WHAT WILL MISTER FOGG SAY AT LEAST I HAVE NOT MISSED THE STEAMER WHICH IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THEN AS FIX OCCURRED TO HIM
3389-130127-0011 A DETECTIVE ON THE TRACK OF MISTER FOGG ACCUSED OF ROBBING THE BANK OF ENGLAND PSHAW MISTER FOGG IS NO MORE A ROBBER THAN I AM A MURDERER SHOULD HE DIVULGE FIX'S REAL ERRAND TO HIS MASTER WOULD IT DO TO TELL THE PART THE DETECTIVE WAS PLAYING
3389-130127-0012 WOULD IT NOT BE BETTER TO WAIT UNTIL MISTER FOGG REACHED LONDON AGAIN
3389-130127-0013 AND HAVE A GOOD LAUGH OVER IT NO DOUBT AT LEAST IT WAS WORTH CONSIDERING THE FIRST THING TO DO WAS TO FIND MISTER FOGG AND APOLOGISE FOR HIS SINGULAR BEHAVIOUR
3389-130127-0014 AS WELL AS HE COULD WITH THE ROLLING OF THE STEAMER TO THE AFTER DECK HE SAW NO ONE WHO RESEMBLED EITHER HIS MASTER OR AOUDA GOOD MUTTERED HE AOUDA HAS NOT GOT UP YET AND MISTER FOGG HAS PROBABLY FOUND SOME PARTNERS AT WHIST HE DESCENDED TO THE SALOON MISTER FOGG WAS NOT THERE

3389-130127-0018 AND DETAIN THE LATTER AT HONG KONG HAD INVEIGLED HIM INTO GETTING DRUNK HE NOW SAW THE DETECTIVE'S TRICK
3389-130127-0019 AND BEGAN TO STUDY HIS SITUATION IT WAS CERTAINLY NOT AN ENVIABLE ONE HE FOUND HIMSELF ON THE WAY TO JAPAN
3389-130127-0020 HIS POCKET WAS EMPTY HE HAD NOT A SOLITARY SHILLING NOT SO MUCH AS A PENNY
3389-130127-0021 THIS IS AN IMPORTANT PORT OF CALL IN THE PACIFIC
3389-130127-0022 AND THE ORIENTAL ISLANDS PUT IN IT IS SITUATED IN THE BAY OF YEDDO AND AT BUT A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THAT SECOND CAPITAL OF THE JAPANESE EMPIRE AND THE RESIDENCE OF THE TYCOON THE CIVIL EMPEROR BEFORE THE MIKADO THE SPIRITUAL EMPEROR ABSORBED HIS OFFICE IN HIS OWN THE CARNATIC
3389-130127-0023 HE HAD NOTHING BETTER TO DO THAN TAKING CHANCE FOR HIS GUIDE TO WANDER AIMLESSLY THROUGH THE STREETS OF YOKOHAMA
3389-130127-0024 THE HOUSES HAVING LOW FRONTS AND BEING ADORNED WITH VERANDAS BENEATH WHICH HE CAUGHT GLIMPSES OF NEAT PERISTYLES THIS QUARTER OCCUPIED WITH ITS STREETS SQUARES DOCKS AND WAREHOUSES ALL THE SPACE BETWEEN THE PROMONTORY OF THE TREATY AND THE RIVER
3389-130127-0025 HERE AS AT HONG KONG AND CALCUTTA WERE MIXED CROWDS OF ALL RACES AMERICANS AND ENGLISH CHINAMEN AND DUTCHMEN MOSTLY MERCHANTS READY TO BUY OR SELL ANYTHING
3389-130127-0026 AS CHANCE DID NOT FAVOUR HIM IN THE EUROPEAN QUARTER
3389-130127-0027 DETERMINED IF NECESSARY TO PUSH ON TO YEDDO THE JAPANESE QUARTER OF YOKOHAMA IS CALLED BENTEN AFTER THE GODDESS OF THE SEA WHO IS WORSHIPPED ON THE ISLANDS ROUND ABOUT
3389-130127-0028 THERE PASSEPARTOUT BEHELD BEAUTIFUL FIR AND CEDAR GROVES SACRED GATES OF A SINGULAR ARCHITECTURE BRIDGES HALF HID IN THE MIDST OF BAMBOOS AND REEDS TEMPLES SHADED BY IMMENSE CEDAR TREES HOLY RETREATS
3389-130127-0029 AND INTERMINABLE STREETS WHERE A PERFECT HARVEST OF ROSE TINTED AND RED CHEEKED CHILDREN
3389-130127-0030 AND WHO WERE PLAYING IN THE MIDST OF SHORT LEGGED POODLES AND YELLOWISH CATS MIGHT HAVE BEEN GATHERED THE STREETS WERE CROWDED WITH PEOPLE PRIESTS WERE PASSING IN PROCESSIONS BEATING THEIR DREARY TAMBOURINES POLICE AND CUSTOM HOUSE OFFICERS WITH POINTED HATS ENCRUSTED WITH LAC AND CARRYING TWO SABRES
3389-130127-0031 HUNG TO THEIR WAISTS SOLDIERS CLAD IN BLUE COTTON WITH WHITE STRIPES AND BEARING GUNS THE MIKADO'S GUARDS
3389-130127-0032 AND NUMBERS OF MILITARY FOLK OF ALL RANKS FOR THE MILITARY PROFESSION IS AS MUCH RESPECTED IN JAPAN AS IT IS DESPISED IN CHINA WENT HITHER AND THITHER IN GROUPS AND PAIRS
3389-130127-0033 AND SIMPLE CIVILIANS WITH THEIR WARPED AND JET BLACK HAIR BIG HEADS LONG BUSTS SLENDER LEGS SHORT STATURE
3389-130127-0034 BUT NEVER YELLOW LIKE THE CHINESE FROM WHOM THE JAPANESE WIDELY DIFFER
3389-130127-0035 CARRIAGES AND PALANQUINS BARROWS SUPPLIED WITH SAILS AND LITTERS MADE OF BAMBOO NOR THE WOMEN WHOM HE THOUGHT NOT ESPECIALLY HANDSOME WHO TOOK LITTLE STEPS WITH THEIR LITTLE FEET WHEREON THEY WORE CANVAS SHOES STRAW SANDALS AND CLOGS OF WORKED WOOD
3389-130127-0036 AND WHO DISPLAYED TIGHT LOOKING EYES FLAT CHESTS TEETH FASHIONABLY BLACKENED AND GOWNS CROSSED WITH SILKEN SCARFS
3389-130127-0037 LOOKING IN AT THE WINDOWS OF THE RICH AND CURIOUS SHOPS THE JEWELLERY ESTABLISHMENTS GLITTERING WITH QUAINT JAPANESE ORNAMENTS THE RESTAURANTS DECKED WITH STREAMERS AND BANNERS THE TEA HOUSES WHERE THE ODOROUS BEVERAGE WAS BEING DRUNK WITH SAKI A LIQUOR CONCOCTED FROM THE FERMENTATION OF RICE
3389-130127-0038 BUT A VERY FINE STRINGY TOBACCO HE WENT ON TILL HE FOUND HIMSELF IN THE FIELDS IN THE MIDST OF VAST RICE PLANTATIONS THERE HE SAW DAZZLING CAMELLIAS EXPANDING THEMSELVES WITH FLOWERS WHICH WERE GIVING FORTH THEIR LAST COLOURS AND PERFUMES
3389-130127-0039 NOT ON BUSHES BUT ON TREES AND WITHIN BAMBOO ENCLOSURES CHERRY PLUM AND APPLE TREES WHICH THE JAPANESE CULTIVATE RATHER FOR THEIR BLOSSOMS THAN THEIR FRUIT AND WHICH QUEERLY FASHIONED GRINNING SCARECROWS PROTECTED FROM THE SPARROWS PIGEONS RAVENS AND OTHER VORACIOUS BIRDS
3389-130127-0040 ON THE BRANCHES OF THE CEDARS WERE PERCHED LARGE EAGLES AMID THE FOLIAGE OF THE WEEPING WILLOWS WERE HERONS SOLEMNLY STANDING ON ONE LEG AND ON EVERY HAND WERE CROWS DUCKS HAWKS WILD BIRDS AND A MULTITUDE OF CRANES
3389-130127-0041 AND WHICH TO THEIR MINDS SYMBOLISE LONG LIFE AND PROSPERITY
3389-130127-0042 GOOD SAID HE I'LL HAVE SOME SUPPER BUT ON SMELLING THEM HE FOUND THAT THEY WERE ODOURLESS NO CHANCE THERE THOUGHT HE THE WORTHY FELLOW HAD CERTAINLY TAKEN GOOD CARE TO EAT AS HEARTY A BREAKFAST AS POSSIBLE BEFORE LEAVING THE CARNATIC
3389-130127-0043 HE MADE UP HIS MIND THAT MEAT WAS FAR FROM PLENTIFUL IN YOKOHAMA NOR WAS HE MISTAKEN AND IN DEFAULT OF BUTCHER'S MEAT
3389-130127-0044 SOME GAME OR FISH WHICH WITH RICE THE JAPANESE EAT ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY
3389-130127-0045 AND TO POSTPONE THE MEAL HE CRAVED TILL THE FOLLOWING MORNING NIGHT CAME
3389-130127-0046 WHERE HE WANDERED THROUGH THE STREETS LIT BY VARI COLOURED LANTERNS LOOKING ON AT THE DANCERS WHO WERE EXECUTING SKILFUL STEPS AND BOUNDINGS AND THE ASTROLOGERS WHO STOOD IN THE OPEN AIR WITH THEIR TELESCOPES
3389-130127-0047 THE STREETS AT LAST BECAME QUIET AND THE PATROL THE OFFICERS OF WHICH IN THEIR SPLENDID COSTUMES AND SURROUNDED BY THEIR SUITES PASSEPARTOUT THOUGHT SEEMED LIKE AMBASSADORS SUCCEEDED THE BUSTLING CROWD
3389-13247-0000 WITH HIS EYES OPEN TO ALL THE POSSIBLE RESULTS
3389-13247-0001 HE CONFRONTED IT WITH A DEGREE OF HESITATION AND A FEELING NEARLY AKIN TO FEAR HE HAD COME DOWN TO THE OFFICE VERY EARLY AND FOR A FEW MINUTES WAS BY HIMSELF HE SAT AT HIS DESK IN A GROWING THOUGHTFULNESS THAT FINALLY BECAME A DESIRE WHICH HE KNEW WAS AS GREAT AS IT WAS UNUSUAL
3389-13247-0002 HE HAD YET TO LEARN WITH ALL THE OTHERS IN THAT LITTLE COMPANY PLEDGED TO DO THE CHRISTLIKE THING THAT THE SPIRIT OF LIFE WAS MOVING IN POWER THROUGH HIS OWN LIFE AS NEVER BEFORE HE ROSE AND SHUT HIS DOOR AND THEN DID WHAT HE HAD NOT DONE FOR YEARS
3389-13247-0003 HE KNEELED DOWN BY HIS DESK AND PRAYED FOR THE DIVINE PRESENCE AND WISDOM TO DIRECT HIM HE ROSE WITH THE DAY BEFORE HIM AND HIS PROMISE DISTINCT AND CLEAR IN HIS MIND NOW FOR ACTION HE SEEMED TO SAY
3389-13247-0004 BUT HE WOULD BE LED BY EVENTS AS FAST AS THEY CAME ON HE OPENED HIS DOOR AND BEGAN THE ROUTINE OF THE OFFICE WORK
3389-13247-0005 ONE OF THE REPORTERS THERE WAS POUNDING OUT SOMETHING ON A TYPEWRITER EDWARD NORMAN BEGAN TO WRITE AN EDITORIAL THE DAILY NEWS WAS AN EVENING PAPER AND NORMAN USUALLY COMPLETED HIS LEADING EDITORIAL BEFORE NINE O'CLOCK HE HAD BEEN WRITING FOR FIFTEEN MINUTES WHEN THE MANAGING EDITOR CALLED OUT
3389-13247-0006 HERE'S THIS PRESS REPORT OF YESTERDAY'S PRIZE FIGHT AT THE RESORT IT WILL MAKE UP THREE COLUMNS AND A HALF I SUPPOSE IT ALL GOES IN
3389-13247-0007 SOMETIMES AS IN THIS CASE IT WAS MERELY A NOMINAL INQUIRY YES NO LET ME SEE IT
3389-13247-0008 VERY HARD THINKING WE WON'T RUN THIS TODAY HE SAID FINALLY
3389-13247-0009 AND THOUGHT HE HAD PERHAPS MISUNDERSTOOD HIM
3389-13247-0010 LEAVE IT OUT WE WON'T USE IT BUT THE MANAGING EDITOR WAS SIMPLY DUMBFOUNDED HE STARED AT NORMAN AS IF THE MAN WAS OUT OF HIS MIND I DON'T THINK CLARK THAT IT OUGHT TO BE PRINTED AND THAT'S THE END OF IT SAID NORMAN LOOKING UP FROM HIS DESK
3389-13247-0011 CLARK SELDOM HAD ANY WORDS WITH THE CHIEF
3389-13247-0012 THE CIRCUMSTANCES NOW HOWEVER SEEMED TO BE SO EXTRAORDINARY THAT CLARK COULD NOT HELP EXPRESSING HIMSELF
3389-13247-0013 YES THAT'S WHAT I MEAN BUT IT'S UNHEARD OF
3389-13247-0014 NORMAN LOOKED AT CLARK THOUGHTFULLY THE MANAGING EDITOR WAS A MEMBER OF A CHURCH OF A DIFFERENT DENOMINATION FROM THAT OF NORMAN'S
3389-13247-0015 COME IN HERE A MINUTE CLARK AND SHUT THE DOOR SAID NORMAN
3389-13247-0016 NORMAN DID NOT SPEAK FOR A MINUTE THEN HE SAID ABRUPTLY CLARK
3389-13247-0017 NO I DON'T SUPPOSE HE WOULD WELL THAT'S MY ONLY REASON FOR SHUTTING THIS ACCOUNT OUT OF THE NEWS
3389-13247-0018 THAT I HONESTLY BELIEVE JESUS WOULD NOT DO
3389-13247-0019 IN FACT HE DID THINK SOMETHING WAS WRONG THOUGH MISTER NORMAN WAS ONE OF THE LAST MEN IN THE WORLD IN HIS JUDGMENT TO LOSE HIS MIND
3389-13247-0020 I THINK IT WILL SIMPLY RUIN THE PAPER REPLIED CLARK PROMPTLY HE WAS GATHERING UP HIS BEWILDERED SENSES AND BEGAN TO REMONSTRATE WHY IT ISN'T FEASIBLE TO RUN A PAPER NOWADAYS ON ANY SUCH BASIS IT'S TOO IDEAL THE WORLD ISN'T READY FOR IT YOU CAN'T MAKE IT PAY
3389-13247-0021 JUST AS SURE AS YOU LIVE IF YOU SHUT OUT THIS PRIZE FIGHT REPORT YOU WILL LOSE HUNDREDS OF SUBSCRIBERS IT DOESN'T TAKE A PROPHET TO SEE THAT THE VERY BEST PEOPLE IN TOWN ARE EAGER TO READ IT
3389-13247-0022 IT WILL BE A GREAT MISTAKE IF YOU DO IN MY OPINION NORMAN SAT SILENT A MINUTE THEN HE SPOKE GENTLY BUT FIRMLY CLARK WHAT IN YOUR HONEST OPINION IS THE RIGHT STANDARD FOR DETERMINING CONDUCT IS THE ONLY RIGHT STANDARD FOR EVERY ONE THE PROBABLE ACTION OF JESUS CHRIST
3389-13247-0023 WHAT WOULD JESUS DO AND THEN DOING IT REGARDLESS OF RESULTS
3389-13247-0024 CLARK TURNED RED AND MOVED UNEASILY IN HIS CHAIR BEFORE HE ANSWERED THE EDITOR'S QUESTION WHY YES
3389-13247-0025 BUT THE QUESTION IS WHAT IS FEASIBLE IS IT POSSIBLE TO MAKE IT PAY
3389-13247-0026 YES THAT'S JUST WHAT I MEAN IT CAN'T BE DONE WE'LL GO BANKRUPT IN THIRTY DAYS NORMAN DID NOT REPLY AT ONCE HE WAS VERY THOUGHTFUL
3389-13247-0027 MEANWHILE I THINK WE OUGHT TO UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER FRANKLY
3389-13247-0028 WHAT WOULD JESUS DO AS HONESTLY AS POSSIBLE I SHALL CONTINUE TO DO THIS IN THE BELIEF THAT NOT ONLY CAN WE SUCCEED
3389-13247-0029 CLARK ROSE THE REPORT DOES NOT GO IN
3389-13247-0030 NO LET THE PAPER GO TO PRESS AS IF THERE HAD BEEN NO SUCH THING AS A PRIZE FIGHT YESTERDAY CLARK WALKED OUT OF THE ROOM TO HIS OWN DESK FEELING AS IF THE BOTTOM HAD DROPPED OUT OF EVERYTHING HE WAS ASTONISHED BEWILDERED EXCITED AND CONSIDERABLY ANGERED
3389-13247-0031 HIS GREAT RESPECT FOR NORMAN CHECKED HIS RISING INDIGNATION AND DISGUST BUT WITH IT ALL WAS A FEELING OF GROWING WONDER AT THE SUDDEN CHANGE OF MOTIVE WHICH HAD ENTERED THE OFFICE OF THE DAILY NEWS AND THREATENED AS HE FIRMLY BELIEVED TO DESTROY IT
3389-13247-0032 THAT THE PAPER WAS GOING TO PRESS WITHOUT A WORD IN IT ABOUT THE FAMOUS PRIZE FIGHT OF SUNDAY
3389-13247-0033 EVERY ONE IN THE STEREOTYPING AND COMPOSING ROOMS HAD SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT THE UNHEARD OF OMISSION TWO OR THREE TIMES DURING THE DAY WHEN MISTER NORMAN HAD OCCASION TO VISIT THE COMPOSING ROOMS THE MEN STOPPED THEIR WORK OR GLANCED AROUND THEIR CASES LOOKING AT HIM CURIOUSLY
3389-13247-0034 BUT SAID NOTHING AND DID NOT APPEAR TO NOTE IT
3389-13247-0035 IN SEVERAL MATTERS BEFORE HE ANSWERED HIS EVER PRESENT QUESTION IN THE RIGHT WAY IT WAS NOT BECAUSE THERE WERE NOT A GREAT MANY THINGS IN THE LIFE OF THE PAPER THAT WERE CONTRARY TO THE SPIRIT OF CHRIST THAT HE DID NOT ACT AT ONCE BUT BECAUSE HE WAS YET HONESTLY IN DOUBT CONCERNING
3389-13247-0036 HUNDREDS OF MEN IN THE HOTELS AND STORES DOWN TOWN AS WELL AS REGULAR SUBSCRIBERS EAGERLY OPENED THE PAPER AND SEARCHED IT THROUGH FOR THE ACCOUNT OF THE GREAT FIGHT
3389-13247-0037 HERE BOY WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOUR PAPER THERE'S NO PRIZE FIGHT HERE
3389-13247-0038 THEN HE WHISTLED WHILE A BEWILDERED LOOK CREPT OVER HIS FACE
3389-13247-0039 HERE GIVE ME ANOTHER PAPER SHOUTED THE CUSTOMER ONE WITH THE PRIZE FIGHT ACCOUNT HE RECEIVED IT AND WALKED OFF WHILE THE TWO BOYS REMAINED COMPARING NOTES AND LOST IN WONDER AT THE RESULT SUMP'N SLIPPED A COG IN THE NEWSY SURE SAID THE FIRST BOY BUT HE COULDN'T TELL WHY AND RAN OVER TO THE NEWS OFFICE TO FIND OUT
3389-13247-0040 WHAT'S THE MATTER HERE GEORGE HE ASKED THE CLERK AS HE NOTED THE UNUSUAL CONFUSION THE BOYS SAY THEY CAN'T SELL ANY COPIES OF THE NEWS TONIGHT BECAUSE THE PRIZE FIGHT ISN'T IN IT REPLIED GEORGE
3389-13247-0041 ON THE WAY HE COULD NOT AVOID THAT CONSTANT QUERY WOULD JESUS HAVE DONE IT
3389-13247-0042 THE NEWSBOYS WERE NECESSARILY SUFFERERS THROUGH THE ACTION HE HAD TAKEN
3389-13248-0000 TWO OR THREE OF THESE LETTERS MAY BE OF INTEREST EDITOR OF THE NEWS DEAR SIR I HAVE BEEN THINKING FOR SOME TIME OF CHANGING MY PAPER I WANT A JOURNAL THAT IS UP TO THE TIMES PROGRESSIVE AND ENTERPRISING SUPPLYING THE PUBLIC DEMAND AT ALL POINTS
3389-13248-0001 THE RECENT FREAK OF YOUR PAPER IN REFUSING TO PRINT THE ACCOUNT OF THE FAMOUS CONTEST AT THE RESORT HAS DECIDED ME FINALLY TO CHANGE MY PAPER
3389-13248-0002 EDWARD NORMAN
3389-13248-0003 WHAT IS THIS SENSATION YOU HAVE GIVEN THE PEOPLE OF YOUR BURG WHAT NEW POLICY HAVE YOU TAKEN UP HOPE YOU DON'T INTEND TO TRY THE REFORM BUSINESS THROUGH THE AVENUE OF THE PRESS IT'S DANGEROUS TO EXPERIMENT MUCH ALONG THAT LINE
3389-13248-0004 TAKE MY ADVICE AND STICK TO THE ENTERPRISING MODERN METHODS YOU HAVE MADE SO SUCCESSFUL FOR THE NEWS THE PUBLIC WANTS PRIZE FIGHTS AND SUCH GIVE IT WHAT IT WANTS AND LET SOME ONE ELSE DO THE REFORMING BUSINESS YOURS HERE FOLLOWED THE NAME OF ONE OF NORMAN'S OLD FRIENDS THE EDITOR OF A DAILY IN AN ADJOINING TOWN
3389-13248-0005 MY DEAR MISTER NORMAN I HASTEN TO WRITE YOU A NOTE OF APPRECIATION FOR THE EVIDENT CARRYING OUT OF YOUR PROMISE
3389-13248-0006 BUT NOT ALL YOUR PASTOR HENRY MAXWELL ONE OTHER LETTER WHICH HE OPENED IMMEDIATELY AFTER READING THIS FROM MAXWELL REVEALED TO HIM SOMETHING OF THE LOSS TO HIS BUSINESS THAT POSSIBLY AWAITED HIM MISTER EDWARD NORMAN EDITOR OF THE DAILY NEWS DEAR SIR
3389-13248-0007 HE HAD BEEN IN THE HABIT OF INSERTING A COLUMN OF CONSPICUOUS ADVERTISING AND PAYING FOR IT A VERY LARGE PRICE
3389-13248-0008 THERE WAS NO CONNECTION IMPLIED IN THE TOBACCO MERCHANT'S LETTER BETWEEN THE OMISSION OF THE PRIZE FIGHT
3389-13248-0009 BUT HE COULD NOT AVOID PUTTING THE TWO TOGETHER
3389-13248-0010 WAS ABOUT TO ENTER UPON SOME QUEER REFORM POLICY
3389-13248-0011 BUT THE LETTER DIRECTED NORMAN'S ATTENTION TO THE ADVERTISING PHASE OF HIS PAPER HE HAD NOT CONSIDERED THIS BEFORE AS HE GLANCED OVER THE COLUMNS HE COULD NOT ESCAPE THE CONVICTION THAT HIS MASTER COULD NOT PERMIT SOME OF THEM IN HIS PAPER
3389-13248-0012 WHAT WOULD HE DO WITH THAT OTHER LONG ADVERTISEMENT OF CHOICE LIQUORS AND CIGARS
3389-13248-0013 NO ONE THOUGHT ANYTHING ABOUT IT IT WAS ALL LEGITIMATE BUSINESS WHY NOT RAYMOND ENJOYED A SYSTEM OF HIGH LICENSE AND THE SALOON AND THE BILLIARD HALL
3389-13248-0014 HE WAS SIMPLY DOING WHAT EVERY OTHER BUSINESS MAN IN RAYMOND DID AND IT WAS ONE OF THE BEST PAYING SOURCES OF REVENUE WHAT WOULD THE PAPER DO IF IT CUT THESE OUT COULD IT LIVE THAT WAS THE QUESTION BUT WAS THAT THE QUESTION AFTER ALL WHAT WOULD JESUS DO THAT WAS THE QUESTION HE WAS ANSWERING OR TRYING TO ANSWER THIS WEEK
3389-13248-0015 WOULD JESUS ADVERTISE WHISKEY AND TOBACCO IN HIS PAPER
3389-13248-0016 HE HANDED THE PAPER WITH THE MARKED PLACES OVER TO CLARK
3389-13248-0017 CLARK DO YOU THINK IF JESUS WAS THE EDITOR AND PROPRIETOR OF A DAILY PAPER IN RAYMOND HE WOULD PERMIT ADVERTISEMENTS OF WHISKEY AND TOBACCO IN IT
3389-13248-0018 WE SHALL CERTAINLY BANKRUPT THE PAPER WITH THIS SORT OF BUSINESS POLICY DO YOU THINK SO NORMAN ASKED THE QUESTION NOT AS IF HE EXPECTED AN ANSWER BUT SIMPLY AS IF HE WERE TALKING WITH HIMSELF AFTER A PAUSE HE SAID YOU MAY DIRECT MARKS TO DO AS I HAVE SAID I BELIEVE IT IS WHAT CHRIST WOULD DO AND AS I TOLD YOU CLARK
3389-13248-0019 I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT BY ANY KIND OF REASONING WE COULD REACH A CONCLUSION JUSTIFYING OUR LORD IN THE ADVERTISEMENT
3389-13248-0020 HE COULD NOT GRASP THE MEANING OF IT ALL HE FELT ENRAGED AND ALARMED HE WAS SURE ANY SUCH POLICY WOULD RUIN THE PAPER AS SOON AS IT BECAME GENERALLY KNOWN THAT THE EDITOR WAS TRYING TO DO EVERYTHING BY SUCH AN ABSURD MORAL STANDARD WHAT WOULD BECOME OF BUSINESS IF THIS STANDARD WAS ADOPTED
3389-13248-0021 IT WOULD UPSET EVERY CUSTOM AND INTRODUCE ENDLESS CONFUSION IT WAS SIMPLY FOOLISHNESS IT WAS DOWNRIGHT IDIOCY
3389-13248-0022 WHAT WAS THE MATTER WITH THE CHIEF WAS HE INSANE WAS HE GOING TO BANKRUPT THE WHOLE BUSINESS BUT EDWARD NORMAN HAD NOT YET FACED HIS MOST SERIOUS PROBLEM WHEN HE CAME DOWN TO THE OFFICE FRIDAY MORNING HE WAS CONFRONTED WITH THE USUAL PROGRAM FOR THE SUNDAY MORNING EDITION
3389-13248-0023 LITERARY AND RELIGIOUS ITEMS TO THIRTY OR FORTY PAGES OF SPORT THEATRE GOSSIP FASHION SOCIETY AND POLITICAL MATERIAL THIS MADE A VERY INTERESTING MAGAZINE OF ALL SORTS OF READING MATTER AND HAD ALWAYS BEEN WELCOMED BY ALL THE SUBSCRIBERS CHURCH MEMBERS AND ALL AS A SUNDAY MORNING NECESSITY
3389-13248-0024 AND THE WORKING MAN ESPECIALLY WHO WOULD NOT GO TO CHURCH ANY WAY
3389-13248-0025 EDWARD NORMAN COMMUNED HONESTLY WITH HIMSELF OVER THE SUBJECT TAKING EVERYTHING INTO ACCOUNT WOULD JESUS PROBABLY EDIT A SUNDAY MORNING PAPER NO MATTER WHETHER IT PAID THAT WAS NOT THE QUESTION
3389-13248-0026 BESIDES THE REGULAR SUBSCRIBERS HAD PAID FOR A SEVEN DAY PAPER
3389-13248-0027 HE WAS HONESTLY PERPLEXED BY THE QUESTION
3389-13248-0028 IT WAS A VERY UNUSUAL PROCEEDING BUT THEY ALL AGREED THAT THE PAPER WAS BEING RUN ON NEW PRINCIPLES ANYHOW AND THEY ALL WATCHED MISTER NORMAN CAREFULLY AS HE SPOKE
3389-13248-0029 I PROPOSE CERTAIN CHANGES WHICH I BELIEVE ARE NECESSARY
3389-13248-0030 I WISH TO STATE MY MOTIVE IN DOING WHAT I HAVE DONE
3389-13248-0031 I SHALL STATE IN THAT ISSUE MY REASONS FOR DISCONTINUING IN ORDER TO MAKE UP TO THE SUBSCRIBERS THE AMOUNT OF READING MATTER THEY MAY SUPPOSE THEMSELVES ENTITLED TO WE CAN ISSUE A DOUBLE NUMBER ON SATURDAY AS IS DONE BY MANY EVENING PAPERS THAT MAKE NO ATTEMPT AT A SUNDAY EDITION
3389-13248-0032 HAS BEEN DONE BY OUR SUNDAY MORNING PAPER I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT JESUS WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR IT IF HE WERE IN MY PLACE TODAY IT WILL OCCASION SOME TROUBLE TO ARRANGE THE DETAILS CAUSED BY THIS CHANGE WITH THE ADVERTISERS AND SUBSCRIBERS THAT IS FOR ME TO LOOK AFTER THE CHANGE ITSELF IS ONE THAT WILL TAKE PLACE
3389-13248-0033 SO FAR AS I CAN SEE THE LOSS WILL FALL ON MYSELF NEITHER THE REPORTERS NOR THE PRESSMEN NEED MAKE ANY PARTICULAR CHANGES IN THEIR PLANS HE LOOKED AROUND THE ROOM AND NO ONE SPOKE
3389-13248-0034 WOULD JESUS DO THAT THAT IS WOULD HE PROBABLY RUN A NEWSPAPER ON SOME LOVING FAMILY PLAN
3389-13248-0035 HE CAUGHT HIMSELF DRAWING ALMOST AWAY FROM THE FACTS OF TYPOGRAPHICAL UNIONS AND
3389-13248-0036 AND ALL THE COLD BUSINESSLIKE METHODS THAT MAKE A GREAT DAILY SUCCESSFUL
3389-13248-0037 CLARK WAS A VERY VALUABLE MAN IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO FILL HIS PLACE BUT HE WAS NOT ABLE TO GIVE ANY REASONS FOR CONTINUING THE SUNDAY PAPER THAT ANSWERED THE QUESTION WHAT WOULD JESUS DO BY LETTING JESUS PRINT THAT EDITION
3389-13248-0038 WE MIGHT AS WELL FACE THAT FUTURE FACT I DON'T THINK WE SHALL WILL YOU STAY BY THE NEWS UNTIL IT IS BANKRUPT ASKED NORMAN WITH A STRANGE SMILE
3389-13250-0000 AND BRETHREN AND SISTERS YEA AND HIS OWN LIFE ALSO HE CANNOT BE MY DISCIPLE AND WHOSOEVER FORSAKETH NOT ALL THAT HE HATH HE CANNOT BE MY DISCIPLE
3389-13250-0001 WHEN RACHEL WINSLOW AND VIRGINIA PAGE SEPARATED AFTER THE MEETING AT THE FIRST CHURCH ON SUNDAY THEY AGREED TO CONTINUE THEIR CONVERSATION THE NEXT DAY VIRGINIA ASKED RACHEL TO COME AND LUNCH WITH HER AT NOON
3389-13250-0002 AND RACHEL ACCORDINGLY RANG THE BELL AT THE PAGE MANSION ABOUT HALF PAST ELEVEN VIRGINIA HERSELF MET HER AND THE TWO WERE SOON TALKING EARNESTLY
3389-13250-0003 I CANNOT RECONCILE IT WITH MY JUDGMENT OF WHAT CHRIST WOULD DO I CANNOT TELL ANOTHER PERSON WHAT TO DO BUT I FEEL THAT I OUGHT NOT TO ACCEPT THIS OFFER WHAT WILL YOU DO THEN ASKED VIRGINIA WITH GREAT INTEREST
3389-13250-0004 RACHEL PICKED UP A LETTER THAT HAD BEEN LYING IN HER LAP AND RAN OVER ITS CONTENTS AGAIN IT WAS A LETTER FROM THE MANAGER OF A COMIC OPERA OFFERING HER A PLACE WITH A LARGE TRAVELING COMPANY OF THE SEASON THE SALARY WAS A VERY LARGE FIGURE
3389-13250-0005 THERE'S NO GREAT VIRTUE IN SAYING NO TO THIS OFFER WHEN I HAVE THE OTHER ONE RACHEL WENT ON THOUGHTFULLY THAT'S HARDER TO DECIDE BUT I'VE ABOUT MADE UP MY MIND TO TELL THE TRUTH VIRGINIA I'M COMPLETELY CONVINCED IN THE FIRST CASE
3389-13250-0006 THAT JESUS WOULD NEVER USE ANY TALENT LIKE A GOOD VOICE JUST TO MAKE MONEY BUT NOW TAKE THIS CONCERT OFFER HERE IS A REPUTABLE COMPANY TO TRAVEL WITH AN IMPERSONATOR AND A VIOLINIST AND A MALE QUARTET ALL PEOPLE OF GOOD REPUTATION
3389-13250-0007 I'M ASKED TO GO AS ONE OF THE COMPANY AND SING LEADING SOPRANO THE SALARY I MENTIONED IT DIDN'T I IS GUARANTEED TO BE TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH FOR THE SEASON BUT I DON'T FEEL SATISFIED THAT JESUS WOULD GO WHAT DO YOU THINK
3389-13250-0008 I BELIEVE MISTER MAXWELL WAS RIGHT
3389-13250-0009 I AM HAVING A HARDER TIME THAN YOU ARE DEAR TO DECIDE WHAT HE WOULD DO ARE YOU RACHEL ASKED
3389-13250-0010 VIRGINIA CAME AND STOOD BY HER
3389-13250-0011 AND THE TWO YOUNG WOMEN LOOKED AT IT SILENTLY FOR A MOMENT SUDDENLY VIRGINIA BROKE OUT AS RACHEL HAD NEVER HEARD HER BEFORE RACHEL
3389-13250-0012 AND OCCASIONALLY TO EASE ITS CONSCIENCE DONATING WITHOUT ANY PERSONAL SACRIFICE A LITTLE MONEY TO CHARITY
3389-13250-0013 LAUNCHED INTO SOCIETY AS AN HEIRESS SUPPOSED TO BE IN A VERY ENVIABLE POSITION I'M PERFECTLY WELL I CAN TRAVEL OR STAY AT HOME I CAN DO AS I PLEASE I CAN GRATIFY ALMOST ANY WANT OR DESIRE AND YET WHEN I HONESTLY TRY TO IMAGINE
3389-13250-0014 I HAVE NOT LOOKED OUT OF THIS WINDOW FOR WEEKS WITHOUT A FEELING OF HORROR TOWARD MYSELF AS I SEE THE HUMANITY THAT PASSES BY THIS HOUSE VIRGINIA TURNED AWAY AND WALKED UP AND DOWN THE ROOM RACHEL WATCHED HER AND COULD NOT REPRESS THE RISING TIDE OF HER OWN GROWING DEFINITION OF DISCIPLESHIP
3389-13250-0015 OF WHAT CHRISTIAN USE WAS HER OWN TALENT OF SONG WAS THE BEST SHE COULD DO TO SELL HER TALENT FOR SO MUCH A MONTH GO ON A CONCERT COMPANY'S TOUR DRESS BEAUTIFULLY ENJOY THE EXCITEMENT OF PUBLIC APPLAUSE AND GAIN A REPUTATION AS A GREAT SINGER
3389-13250-0016 WAS THAT WHAT JESUS WOULD DO SHE WAS NOT MORBID
3389-13250-0017 AND KNEW THAT IF SHE WENT OUT INTO PUBLIC LIFE SHE COULD MAKE A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY AND BECOME WELL KNOWN
3389-13250-0018 WHAT SHE HAD JUST SAID SMOTE RACHEL WITH GREAT FORCE BECAUSE OF THE SIMILAR POSITION IN WHICH THE TWO FRIENDS FOUND THEMSELVES LUNCH WAS ANNOUNCED AND THEY WENT OUT AND WERE JOINED BY VIRGINIA'S GRANDMOTHER MADAM PAGE A HANDSOME STATELY WOMAN OF SIXTY FIVE
3389-13250-0019 AND VIRGINIA'S BROTHER ROLLIN A YOUNG MAN WHO SPENT MOST OF HIS TIME AT ONE OF THE CLUBS AND HAD NO AMBITION FOR ANYTHING BUT A GROWING ADMIRATION FOR RACHEL WINSLOW

3389-13250-0021 OF WEALTH AND SOCIAL STANDING THAT HAVE NEVER BEEN DISTURBED SHE WAS A SHREWD CAREFUL BUSINESS WOMAN OF MORE THAN AVERAGE ABILITY
3389-13250-0022 VIRGINIA'S PORTION WAS WITHOUT ANY RESTRICTION HER OWN SHE HAD BEEN TRAINED BY HER FATHER TO UNDERSTAND THE WAYS OF THE BUSINESS WORLD AND EVEN THE GRANDMOTHER HAD BEEN COMPELLED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE GIRL'S CAPACITY FOR TAKING CARE OF HER OWN MONEY
3389-13250-0023 THAN MADAM PAGE AND ROLLIN RACHEL WHO HAD KNOWN THE FAMILY SINCE SHE WAS A GIRL PLAYMATE OF VIRGINIA'S COULD NOT HELP THINKING OF WHAT CONFRONTED VIRGINIA IN HER OWN HOME WHEN SHE ONCE DECIDED ON THE COURSE WHICH SHE HONESTLY BELIEVED JESUS WOULD TAKE
3389-13250-0024 TODAY AT LUNCH AS SHE RECALLED VIRGINIA'S OUTBREAK IN THE FRONT ROOM SHE TRIED TO PICTURE THE SCENE THAT WOULD AT SOME TIME OCCUR BETWEEN MADAM PAGE AND HER GRANDDAUGHTER I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU ARE GOING ON THE STAGE MISS WINSLOW WE SHALL ALL BE DELIGHTED I'M SURE SAID ROLLIN DURING THE CONVERSATION

3389-13250-0030 CONCERNING THE CONCERT COMPANY'S OFFER
3389-13250-0031 SOMEHOW WHAT ROLLIN PAGE HAD SAID AND HIS MANNER IN SAYING IT HAD HASTENED HER DECISION IN THE MATTER WOULD YOU MIND TELLING US RACHEL YOUR REASONS FOR REFUSING THE OFFER
3389-13250-0032 DON'T YOU THINK THE GENERAL PUBLIC OUGHT TO HEAR YOU
3389-13250-0033 SHE SPOKE NOW IN REPLY TO MADAM PAGE IN ONE OF THOSE RARE MOMENTS OF UNRESERVE THAT ADDED TO THE ATTRACTIVENESS OF HER WHOLE CHARACTER
3389-13250-0034 LOOKING INTO MADAM PAGE'S EYES WITH A CLEAR EARNEST GAZE MADAM PAGE TURNED RED AND ROLLIN STARED BEFORE HER GRANDMOTHER COULD SAY ANYTHING VIRGINIA SPOKE HER RISING COLOR SHOWED HOW SHE WAS STIRRED VIRGINIA'S PALE CLEAR COMPLEXION WAS THAT OF HEALTH
3389-13250-0035 MISTER MAXWELL'S PROPOSITION WAS PLAIN TO ALL WHO HEARD IT WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO ARRIVE AT OUR DECISIONS VERY RAPIDLY
3389-13250-0036 MADAM PAGE LOOKED SHARPLY AT VIRGINIA BEFORE SHE SAID ANYTHING OF COURSE I UNDERSTAND MISTER MAXWELL'S STATEMENT

3389-13250-0039 EXCUSE ME LADIES SAID ROLLIN RISING FROM THE TABLE THE CONVERSATION IS GETTING BEYOND MY DEPTH
3389-13250-0040 MADAM PAGE WAITED UNTIL THE SERVANT HAD BROUGHT IN SOMETHING AND THEN ASKED HER TO GO OUT
3389-13250-0041 I AM OLDER BY SEVERAL YEARS THAN YOU YOUNG LADIES SHE SAID AND HER TRADITIONAL TYPE OF BEARING SEEMED TO RACHEL TO RISE UP LIKE A GREAT FROZEN WALL BETWEEN HER AND EVERY CONCEPTION OF JESUS AS A SACRIFICE WHAT YOU HAVE PROMISED IN A SPIRIT OF FALSE EMOTION I PRESUME IS IMPOSSIBLE OF PERFORMANCE
