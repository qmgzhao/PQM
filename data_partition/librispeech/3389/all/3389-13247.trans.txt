3389-13247-0000 WITH HIS EYES OPEN TO ALL THE POSSIBLE RESULTS
3389-13247-0001 HE CONFRONTED IT WITH A DEGREE OF HESITATION AND A FEELING NEARLY AKIN TO FEAR HE HAD COME DOWN TO THE OFFICE VERY EARLY AND FOR A FEW MINUTES WAS BY HIMSELF HE SAT AT HIS DESK IN A GROWING THOUGHTFULNESS THAT FINALLY BECAME A DESIRE WHICH HE KNEW WAS AS GREAT AS IT WAS UNUSUAL
3389-13247-0002 HE HAD YET TO LEARN WITH ALL THE OTHERS IN THAT LITTLE COMPANY PLEDGED TO DO THE CHRISTLIKE THING THAT THE SPIRIT OF LIFE WAS MOVING IN POWER THROUGH HIS OWN LIFE AS NEVER BEFORE HE ROSE AND SHUT HIS DOOR AND THEN DID WHAT HE HAD NOT DONE FOR YEARS
3389-13247-0003 HE KNEELED DOWN BY HIS DESK AND PRAYED FOR THE DIVINE PRESENCE AND WISDOM TO DIRECT HIM HE ROSE WITH THE DAY BEFORE HIM AND HIS PROMISE DISTINCT AND CLEAR IN HIS MIND NOW FOR ACTION HE SEEMED TO SAY
3389-13247-0004 BUT HE WOULD BE LED BY EVENTS AS FAST AS THEY CAME ON HE OPENED HIS DOOR AND BEGAN THE ROUTINE OF THE OFFICE WORK
3389-13247-0005 ONE OF THE REPORTERS THERE WAS POUNDING OUT SOMETHING ON A TYPEWRITER EDWARD NORMAN BEGAN TO WRITE AN EDITORIAL THE DAILY NEWS WAS AN EVENING PAPER AND NORMAN USUALLY COMPLETED HIS LEADING EDITORIAL BEFORE NINE O'CLOCK HE HAD BEEN WRITING FOR FIFTEEN MINUTES WHEN THE MANAGING EDITOR CALLED OUT
3389-13247-0006 HERE'S THIS PRESS REPORT OF YESTERDAY'S PRIZE FIGHT AT THE RESORT IT WILL MAKE UP THREE COLUMNS AND A HALF I SUPPOSE IT ALL GOES IN
3389-13247-0007 SOMETIMES AS IN THIS CASE IT WAS MERELY A NOMINAL INQUIRY YES NO LET ME SEE IT
3389-13247-0008 VERY HARD THINKING WE WON'T RUN THIS TODAY HE SAID FINALLY
3389-13247-0009 AND THOUGHT HE HAD PERHAPS MISUNDERSTOOD HIM
3389-13247-0010 LEAVE IT OUT WE WON'T USE IT BUT THE MANAGING EDITOR WAS SIMPLY DUMBFOUNDED HE STARED AT NORMAN AS IF THE MAN WAS OUT OF HIS MIND I DON'T THINK CLARK THAT IT OUGHT TO BE PRINTED AND THAT'S THE END OF IT SAID NORMAN LOOKING UP FROM HIS DESK
3389-13247-0011 CLARK SELDOM HAD ANY WORDS WITH THE CHIEF
3389-13247-0012 THE CIRCUMSTANCES NOW HOWEVER SEEMED TO BE SO EXTRAORDINARY THAT CLARK COULD NOT HELP EXPRESSING HIMSELF
3389-13247-0013 YES THAT'S WHAT I MEAN BUT IT'S UNHEARD OF
3389-13247-0014 NORMAN LOOKED AT CLARK THOUGHTFULLY THE MANAGING EDITOR WAS A MEMBER OF A CHURCH OF A DIFFERENT DENOMINATION FROM THAT OF NORMAN'S
3389-13247-0015 COME IN HERE A MINUTE CLARK AND SHUT THE DOOR SAID NORMAN
3389-13247-0016 NORMAN DID NOT SPEAK FOR A MINUTE THEN HE SAID ABRUPTLY CLARK
3389-13247-0017 NO I DON'T SUPPOSE HE WOULD WELL THAT'S MY ONLY REASON FOR SHUTTING THIS ACCOUNT OUT OF THE NEWS
3389-13247-0018 THAT I HONESTLY BELIEVE JESUS WOULD NOT DO
3389-13247-0019 IN FACT HE DID THINK SOMETHING WAS WRONG THOUGH MISTER NORMAN WAS ONE OF THE LAST MEN IN THE WORLD IN HIS JUDGMENT TO LOSE HIS MIND
3389-13247-0020 I THINK IT WILL SIMPLY RUIN THE PAPER REPLIED CLARK PROMPTLY HE WAS GATHERING UP HIS BEWILDERED SENSES AND BEGAN TO REMONSTRATE WHY IT ISN'T FEASIBLE TO RUN A PAPER NOWADAYS ON ANY SUCH BASIS IT'S TOO IDEAL THE WORLD ISN'T READY FOR IT YOU CAN'T MAKE IT PAY
3389-13247-0021 JUST AS SURE AS YOU LIVE IF YOU SHUT OUT THIS PRIZE FIGHT REPORT YOU WILL LOSE HUNDREDS OF SUBSCRIBERS IT DOESN'T TAKE A PROPHET TO SEE THAT THE VERY BEST PEOPLE IN TOWN ARE EAGER TO READ IT
3389-13247-0022 IT WILL BE A GREAT MISTAKE IF YOU DO IN MY OPINION NORMAN SAT SILENT A MINUTE THEN HE SPOKE GENTLY BUT FIRMLY CLARK WHAT IN YOUR HONEST OPINION IS THE RIGHT STANDARD FOR DETERMINING CONDUCT IS THE ONLY RIGHT STANDARD FOR EVERY ONE THE PROBABLE ACTION OF JESUS CHRIST
3389-13247-0023 WHAT WOULD JESUS DO AND THEN DOING IT REGARDLESS OF RESULTS
3389-13247-0024 CLARK TURNED RED AND MOVED UNEASILY IN HIS CHAIR BEFORE HE ANSWERED THE EDITOR'S QUESTION WHY YES
3389-13247-0025 BUT THE QUESTION IS WHAT IS FEASIBLE IS IT POSSIBLE TO MAKE IT PAY
3389-13247-0026 YES THAT'S JUST WHAT I MEAN IT CAN'T BE DONE WE'LL GO BANKRUPT IN THIRTY DAYS NORMAN DID NOT REPLY AT ONCE HE WAS VERY THOUGHTFUL
3389-13247-0027 MEANWHILE I THINK WE OUGHT TO UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER FRANKLY
3389-13247-0028 WHAT WOULD JESUS DO AS HONESTLY AS POSSIBLE I SHALL CONTINUE TO DO THIS IN THE BELIEF THAT NOT ONLY CAN WE SUCCEED
3389-13247-0029 CLARK ROSE THE REPORT DOES NOT GO IN
3389-13247-0030 NO LET THE PAPER GO TO PRESS AS IF THERE HAD BEEN NO SUCH THING AS A PRIZE FIGHT YESTERDAY CLARK WALKED OUT OF THE ROOM TO HIS OWN DESK FEELING AS IF THE BOTTOM HAD DROPPED OUT OF EVERYTHING HE WAS ASTONISHED BEWILDERED EXCITED AND CONSIDERABLY ANGERED
3389-13247-0031 HIS GREAT RESPECT FOR NORMAN CHECKED HIS RISING INDIGNATION AND DISGUST BUT WITH IT ALL WAS A FEELING OF GROWING WONDER AT THE SUDDEN CHANGE OF MOTIVE WHICH HAD ENTERED THE OFFICE OF THE DAILY NEWS AND THREATENED AS HE FIRMLY BELIEVED TO DESTROY IT
3389-13247-0032 THAT THE PAPER WAS GOING TO PRESS WITHOUT A WORD IN IT ABOUT THE FAMOUS PRIZE FIGHT OF SUNDAY
3389-13247-0033 EVERY ONE IN THE STEREOTYPING AND COMPOSING ROOMS HAD SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT THE UNHEARD OF OMISSION TWO OR THREE TIMES DURING THE DAY WHEN MISTER NORMAN HAD OCCASION TO VISIT THE COMPOSING ROOMS THE MEN STOPPED THEIR WORK OR GLANCED AROUND THEIR CASES LOOKING AT HIM CURIOUSLY
3389-13247-0034 BUT SAID NOTHING AND DID NOT APPEAR TO NOTE IT
3389-13247-0035 IN SEVERAL MATTERS BEFORE HE ANSWERED HIS EVER PRESENT QUESTION IN THE RIGHT WAY IT WAS NOT BECAUSE THERE WERE NOT A GREAT MANY THINGS IN THE LIFE OF THE PAPER THAT WERE CONTRARY TO THE SPIRIT OF CHRIST THAT HE DID NOT ACT AT ONCE BUT BECAUSE HE WAS YET HONESTLY IN DOUBT CONCERNING
3389-13247-0036 HUNDREDS OF MEN IN THE HOTELS AND STORES DOWN TOWN AS WELL AS REGULAR SUBSCRIBERS EAGERLY OPENED THE PAPER AND SEARCHED IT THROUGH FOR THE ACCOUNT OF THE GREAT FIGHT
3389-13247-0037 HERE BOY WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOUR PAPER THERE'S NO PRIZE FIGHT HERE
3389-13247-0038 THEN HE WHISTLED WHILE A BEWILDERED LOOK CREPT OVER HIS FACE
3389-13247-0039 HERE GIVE ME ANOTHER PAPER SHOUTED THE CUSTOMER ONE WITH THE PRIZE FIGHT ACCOUNT HE RECEIVED IT AND WALKED OFF WHILE THE TWO BOYS REMAINED COMPARING NOTES AND LOST IN WONDER AT THE RESULT SUMP'N SLIPPED A COG IN THE NEWSY SURE SAID THE FIRST BOY BUT HE COULDN'T TELL WHY AND RAN OVER TO THE NEWS OFFICE TO FIND OUT
3389-13247-0040 WHAT'S THE MATTER HERE GEORGE HE ASKED THE CLERK AS HE NOTED THE UNUSUAL CONFUSION THE BOYS SAY THEY CAN'T SELL ANY COPIES OF THE NEWS TONIGHT BECAUSE THE PRIZE FIGHT ISN'T IN IT REPLIED GEORGE
3389-13247-0041 ON THE WAY HE COULD NOT AVOID THAT CONSTANT QUERY WOULD JESUS HAVE DONE IT
3389-13247-0042 THE NEWSBOYS WERE NECESSARILY SUFFERERS THROUGH THE ACTION HE HAD TAKEN
