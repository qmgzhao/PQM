3389-130127-0034 BUT NEVER YELLOW LIKE THE CHINESE FROM WHOM THE JAPANESE WIDELY DIFFER
3389-130127-0035 CARRIAGES AND PALANQUINS BARROWS SUPPLIED WITH SAILS AND LITTERS MADE OF BAMBOO NOR THE WOMEN WHOM HE THOUGHT NOT ESPECIALLY HANDSOME WHO TOOK LITTLE STEPS WITH THEIR LITTLE FEET WHEREON THEY WORE CANVAS SHOES STRAW SANDALS AND CLOGS OF WORKED WOOD
3389-130127-0036 AND WHO DISPLAYED TIGHT LOOKING EYES FLAT CHESTS TEETH FASHIONABLY BLACKENED AND GOWNS CROSSED WITH SILKEN SCARFS

3389-130127-0038 BUT A VERY FINE STRINGY TOBACCO HE WENT ON TILL HE FOUND HIMSELF IN THE FIELDS IN THE MIDST OF VAST RICE PLANTATIONS THERE HE SAW DAZZLING CAMELLIAS EXPANDING THEMSELVES WITH FLOWERS WHICH WERE GIVING FORTH THEIR LAST COLOURS AND PERFUMES
3389-130127-0039 NOT ON BUSHES BUT ON TREES AND WITHIN BAMBOO ENCLOSURES CHERRY PLUM AND APPLE TREES WHICH THE JAPANESE CULTIVATE RATHER FOR THEIR BLOSSOMS THAN THEIR FRUIT AND WHICH QUEERLY FASHIONED GRINNING SCARECROWS PROTECTED FROM THE SPARROWS PIGEONS RAVENS AND OTHER VORACIOUS BIRDS

3389-130127-0043 HE MADE UP HIS MIND THAT MEAT WAS FAR FROM PLENTIFUL IN YOKOHAMA NOR WAS HE MISTAKEN AND IN DEFAULT OF BUTCHER'S MEAT
3389-130127-0044 SOME GAME OR FISH WHICH WITH RICE THE JAPANESE EAT ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY
3389-130127-0045 AND TO POSTPONE THE MEAL HE CRAVED TILL THE FOLLOWING MORNING NIGHT CAME
3389-130127-0046 WHERE HE WANDERED THROUGH THE STREETS LIT BY VARI COLOURED LANTERNS LOOKING ON AT THE DANCERS WHO WERE EXECUTING SKILFUL STEPS AND BOUNDINGS AND THE ASTROLOGERS WHO STOOD IN THE OPEN AIR WITH THEIR TELESCOPES
