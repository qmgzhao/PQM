3389-13250-0001 WHEN RACHEL WINSLOW AND VIRGINIA PAGE SEPARATED AFTER THE MEETING AT THE FIRST CHURCH ON SUNDAY THEY AGREED TO CONTINUE THEIR CONVERSATION THE NEXT DAY VIRGINIA ASKED RACHEL TO COME AND LUNCH WITH HER AT NOON
3389-13250-0002 AND RACHEL ACCORDINGLY RANG THE BELL AT THE PAGE MANSION ABOUT HALF PAST ELEVEN VIRGINIA HERSELF MET HER AND THE TWO WERE SOON TALKING EARNESTLY
3389-13250-0003 I CANNOT RECONCILE IT WITH MY JUDGMENT OF WHAT CHRIST WOULD DO I CANNOT TELL ANOTHER PERSON WHAT TO DO BUT I FEEL THAT I OUGHT NOT TO ACCEPT THIS OFFER WHAT WILL YOU DO THEN ASKED VIRGINIA WITH GREAT INTEREST
3389-13250-0004 RACHEL PICKED UP A LETTER THAT HAD BEEN LYING IN HER LAP AND RAN OVER ITS CONTENTS AGAIN IT WAS A LETTER FROM THE MANAGER OF A COMIC OPERA OFFERING HER A PLACE WITH A LARGE TRAVELING COMPANY OF THE SEASON THE SALARY WAS A VERY LARGE FIGURE
3389-13250-0005 THERE'S NO GREAT VIRTUE IN SAYING NO TO THIS OFFER WHEN I HAVE THE OTHER ONE RACHEL WENT ON THOUGHTFULLY THAT'S HARDER TO DECIDE BUT I'VE ABOUT MADE UP MY MIND TO TELL THE TRUTH VIRGINIA I'M COMPLETELY CONVINCED IN THE FIRST CASE
3389-13250-0006 THAT JESUS WOULD NEVER USE ANY TALENT LIKE A GOOD VOICE JUST TO MAKE MONEY BUT NOW TAKE THIS CONCERT OFFER HERE IS A REPUTABLE COMPANY TO TRAVEL WITH AN IMPERSONATOR AND A VIOLINIST AND A MALE QUARTET ALL PEOPLE OF GOOD REPUTATION
3389-13250-0007 I'M ASKED TO GO AS ONE OF THE COMPANY AND SING LEADING SOPRANO THE SALARY I MENTIONED IT DIDN'T I IS GUARANTEED TO BE TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH FOR THE SEASON BUT I DON'T FEEL SATISFIED THAT JESUS WOULD GO WHAT DO YOU THINK

3389-13250-0009 I AM HAVING A HARDER TIME THAN YOU ARE DEAR TO DECIDE WHAT HE WOULD DO ARE YOU RACHEL ASKED
3389-13250-0010 VIRGINIA CAME AND STOOD BY HER
3389-13250-0011 AND THE TWO YOUNG WOMEN LOOKED AT IT SILENTLY FOR A MOMENT SUDDENLY VIRGINIA BROKE OUT AS RACHEL HAD NEVER HEARD HER BEFORE RACHEL
3389-13250-0012 AND OCCASIONALLY TO EASE ITS CONSCIENCE DONATING WITHOUT ANY PERSONAL SACRIFICE A LITTLE MONEY TO CHARITY
3389-13250-0013 LAUNCHED INTO SOCIETY AS AN HEIRESS SUPPOSED TO BE IN A VERY ENVIABLE POSITION I'M PERFECTLY WELL I CAN TRAVEL OR STAY AT HOME I CAN DO AS I PLEASE I CAN GRATIFY ALMOST ANY WANT OR DESIRE AND YET WHEN I HONESTLY TRY TO IMAGINE
3389-13250-0014 I HAVE NOT LOOKED OUT OF THIS WINDOW FOR WEEKS WITHOUT A FEELING OF HORROR TOWARD MYSELF AS I SEE THE HUMANITY THAT PASSES BY THIS HOUSE VIRGINIA TURNED AWAY AND WALKED UP AND DOWN THE ROOM RACHEL WATCHED HER AND COULD NOT REPRESS THE RISING TIDE OF HER OWN GROWING DEFINITION OF DISCIPLESHIP
3389-13250-0015 OF WHAT CHRISTIAN USE WAS HER OWN TALENT OF SONG WAS THE BEST SHE COULD DO TO SELL HER TALENT FOR SO MUCH A MONTH GO ON A CONCERT COMPANY'S TOUR DRESS BEAUTIFULLY ENJOY THE EXCITEMENT OF PUBLIC APPLAUSE AND GAIN A REPUTATION AS A GREAT SINGER
3389-13250-0016 WAS THAT WHAT JESUS WOULD DO SHE WAS NOT MORBID
3389-13250-0017 AND KNEW THAT IF SHE WENT OUT INTO PUBLIC LIFE SHE COULD MAKE A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY AND BECOME WELL KNOWN
3389-13250-0018 WHAT SHE HAD JUST SAID SMOTE RACHEL WITH GREAT FORCE BECAUSE OF THE SIMILAR POSITION IN WHICH THE TWO FRIENDS FOUND THEMSELVES LUNCH WAS ANNOUNCED AND THEY WENT OUT AND WERE JOINED BY VIRGINIA'S GRANDMOTHER MADAM PAGE A HANDSOME STATELY WOMAN OF SIXTY FIVE
3389-13250-0019 AND VIRGINIA'S BROTHER ROLLIN A YOUNG MAN WHO SPENT MOST OF HIS TIME AT ONE OF THE CLUBS AND HAD NO AMBITION FOR ANYTHING BUT A GROWING ADMIRATION FOR RACHEL WINSLOW

3389-13250-0021 OF WEALTH AND SOCIAL STANDING THAT HAVE NEVER BEEN DISTURBED SHE WAS A SHREWD CAREFUL BUSINESS WOMAN OF MORE THAN AVERAGE ABILITY
3389-13250-0022 VIRGINIA'S PORTION WAS WITHOUT ANY RESTRICTION HER OWN SHE HAD BEEN TRAINED BY HER FATHER TO UNDERSTAND THE WAYS OF THE BUSINESS WORLD AND EVEN THE GRANDMOTHER HAD BEEN COMPELLED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE GIRL'S CAPACITY FOR TAKING CARE OF HER OWN MONEY
3389-13250-0023 THAN MADAM PAGE AND ROLLIN RACHEL WHO HAD KNOWN THE FAMILY SINCE SHE WAS A GIRL PLAYMATE OF VIRGINIA'S COULD NOT HELP THINKING OF WHAT CONFRONTED VIRGINIA IN HER OWN HOME WHEN SHE ONCE DECIDED ON THE COURSE WHICH SHE HONESTLY BELIEVED JESUS WOULD TAKE
3389-13250-0024 TODAY AT LUNCH AS SHE RECALLED VIRGINIA'S OUTBREAK IN THE FRONT ROOM SHE TRIED TO PICTURE THE SCENE THAT WOULD AT SOME TIME OCCUR BETWEEN MADAM PAGE AND HER GRANDDAUGHTER I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU ARE GOING ON THE STAGE MISS WINSLOW WE SHALL ALL BE DELIGHTED I'M SURE SAID ROLLIN DURING THE CONVERSATION
3389-13250-0025 WHICH HAD NOT BEEN VERY ANIMATED RACHEL COLORED AND FELT ANNOYED WHO TOLD YOU SHE ASKED

3389-13250-0033 SHE SPOKE NOW IN REPLY TO MADAM PAGE IN ONE OF THOSE RARE MOMENTS OF UNRESERVE THAT ADDED TO THE ATTRACTIVENESS OF HER WHOLE CHARACTER
3389-13250-0034 LOOKING INTO MADAM PAGE'S EYES WITH A CLEAR EARNEST GAZE MADAM PAGE TURNED RED AND ROLLIN STARED BEFORE HER GRANDMOTHER COULD SAY ANYTHING VIRGINIA SPOKE HER RISING COLOR SHOWED HOW SHE WAS STIRRED VIRGINIA'S PALE CLEAR COMPLEXION WAS THAT OF HEALTH

3389-13250-0040 MADAM PAGE WAITED UNTIL THE SERVANT HAD BROUGHT IN SOMETHING AND THEN ASKED HER TO GO OUT
3389-13250-0041 I AM OLDER BY SEVERAL YEARS THAN YOU YOUNG LADIES SHE SAID AND HER TRADITIONAL TYPE OF BEARING SEEMED TO RACHEL TO RISE UP LIKE A GREAT FROZEN WALL BETWEEN HER AND EVERY CONCEPTION OF JESUS AS A SACRIFICE WHAT YOU HAVE PROMISED IN A SPIRIT OF FALSE EMOTION I PRESUME IS IMPOSSIBLE OF PERFORMANCE

3389-13250-0043 BESIDES HOW CAN YOU ACT WITH ANY MADAM PAGE PAUSED BROKE OFF HER SENTENCE AND THEN TURNED TO RACHEL WHAT WILL YOUR MOTHER SAY TO YOUR DECISION MY DEAR IS IT NOT FOOLISH
