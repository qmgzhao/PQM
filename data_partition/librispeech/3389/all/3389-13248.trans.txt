3389-13248-0000 TWO OR THREE OF THESE LETTERS MAY BE OF INTEREST EDITOR OF THE NEWS DEAR SIR I HAVE BEEN THINKING FOR SOME TIME OF CHANGING MY PAPER I WANT A JOURNAL THAT IS UP TO THE TIMES PROGRESSIVE AND ENTERPRISING SUPPLYING THE PUBLIC DEMAND AT ALL POINTS
3389-13248-0001 THE RECENT FREAK OF YOUR PAPER IN REFUSING TO PRINT THE ACCOUNT OF THE FAMOUS CONTEST AT THE RESORT HAS DECIDED ME FINALLY TO CHANGE MY PAPER
3389-13248-0002 EDWARD NORMAN
3389-13248-0003 WHAT IS THIS SENSATION YOU HAVE GIVEN THE PEOPLE OF YOUR BURG WHAT NEW POLICY HAVE YOU TAKEN UP HOPE YOU DON'T INTEND TO TRY THE REFORM BUSINESS THROUGH THE AVENUE OF THE PRESS IT'S DANGEROUS TO EXPERIMENT MUCH ALONG THAT LINE
3389-13248-0004 TAKE MY ADVICE AND STICK TO THE ENTERPRISING MODERN METHODS YOU HAVE MADE SO SUCCESSFUL FOR THE NEWS THE PUBLIC WANTS PRIZE FIGHTS AND SUCH GIVE IT WHAT IT WANTS AND LET SOME ONE ELSE DO THE REFORMING BUSINESS YOURS HERE FOLLOWED THE NAME OF ONE OF NORMAN'S OLD FRIENDS THE EDITOR OF A DAILY IN AN ADJOINING TOWN
3389-13248-0005 MY DEAR MISTER NORMAN I HASTEN TO WRITE YOU A NOTE OF APPRECIATION FOR THE EVIDENT CARRYING OUT OF YOUR PROMISE
3389-13248-0006 BUT NOT ALL YOUR PASTOR HENRY MAXWELL ONE OTHER LETTER WHICH HE OPENED IMMEDIATELY AFTER READING THIS FROM MAXWELL REVEALED TO HIM SOMETHING OF THE LOSS TO HIS BUSINESS THAT POSSIBLY AWAITED HIM MISTER EDWARD NORMAN EDITOR OF THE DAILY NEWS DEAR SIR
3389-13248-0007 HE HAD BEEN IN THE HABIT OF INSERTING A COLUMN OF CONSPICUOUS ADVERTISING AND PAYING FOR IT A VERY LARGE PRICE
3389-13248-0008 THERE WAS NO CONNECTION IMPLIED IN THE TOBACCO MERCHANT'S LETTER BETWEEN THE OMISSION OF THE PRIZE FIGHT
3389-13248-0009 BUT HE COULD NOT AVOID PUTTING THE TWO TOGETHER
3389-13248-0010 WAS ABOUT TO ENTER UPON SOME QUEER REFORM POLICY
3389-13248-0011 BUT THE LETTER DIRECTED NORMAN'S ATTENTION TO THE ADVERTISING PHASE OF HIS PAPER HE HAD NOT CONSIDERED THIS BEFORE AS HE GLANCED OVER THE COLUMNS HE COULD NOT ESCAPE THE CONVICTION THAT HIS MASTER COULD NOT PERMIT SOME OF THEM IN HIS PAPER
3389-13248-0012 WHAT WOULD HE DO WITH THAT OTHER LONG ADVERTISEMENT OF CHOICE LIQUORS AND CIGARS
3389-13248-0013 NO ONE THOUGHT ANYTHING ABOUT IT IT WAS ALL LEGITIMATE BUSINESS WHY NOT RAYMOND ENJOYED A SYSTEM OF HIGH LICENSE AND THE SALOON AND THE BILLIARD HALL
3389-13248-0014 HE WAS SIMPLY DOING WHAT EVERY OTHER BUSINESS MAN IN RAYMOND DID AND IT WAS ONE OF THE BEST PAYING SOURCES OF REVENUE WHAT WOULD THE PAPER DO IF IT CUT THESE OUT COULD IT LIVE THAT WAS THE QUESTION BUT WAS THAT THE QUESTION AFTER ALL WHAT WOULD JESUS DO THAT WAS THE QUESTION HE WAS ANSWERING OR TRYING TO ANSWER THIS WEEK
3389-13248-0015 WOULD JESUS ADVERTISE WHISKEY AND TOBACCO IN HIS PAPER
3389-13248-0016 HE HANDED THE PAPER WITH THE MARKED PLACES OVER TO CLARK
3389-13248-0017 CLARK DO YOU THINK IF JESUS WAS THE EDITOR AND PROPRIETOR OF A DAILY PAPER IN RAYMOND HE WOULD PERMIT ADVERTISEMENTS OF WHISKEY AND TOBACCO IN IT
3389-13248-0018 WE SHALL CERTAINLY BANKRUPT THE PAPER WITH THIS SORT OF BUSINESS POLICY DO YOU THINK SO NORMAN ASKED THE QUESTION NOT AS IF HE EXPECTED AN ANSWER BUT SIMPLY AS IF HE WERE TALKING WITH HIMSELF AFTER A PAUSE HE SAID YOU MAY DIRECT MARKS TO DO AS I HAVE SAID I BELIEVE IT IS WHAT CHRIST WOULD DO AND AS I TOLD YOU CLARK
3389-13248-0019 I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT BY ANY KIND OF REASONING WE COULD REACH A CONCLUSION JUSTIFYING OUR LORD IN THE ADVERTISEMENT
3389-13248-0020 HE COULD NOT GRASP THE MEANING OF IT ALL HE FELT ENRAGED AND ALARMED HE WAS SURE ANY SUCH POLICY WOULD RUIN THE PAPER AS SOON AS IT BECAME GENERALLY KNOWN THAT THE EDITOR WAS TRYING TO DO EVERYTHING BY SUCH AN ABSURD MORAL STANDARD WHAT WOULD BECOME OF BUSINESS IF THIS STANDARD WAS ADOPTED
3389-13248-0021 IT WOULD UPSET EVERY CUSTOM AND INTRODUCE ENDLESS CONFUSION IT WAS SIMPLY FOOLISHNESS IT WAS DOWNRIGHT IDIOCY
3389-13248-0022 WHAT WAS THE MATTER WITH THE CHIEF WAS HE INSANE WAS HE GOING TO BANKRUPT THE WHOLE BUSINESS BUT EDWARD NORMAN HAD NOT YET FACED HIS MOST SERIOUS PROBLEM WHEN HE CAME DOWN TO THE OFFICE FRIDAY MORNING HE WAS CONFRONTED WITH THE USUAL PROGRAM FOR THE SUNDAY MORNING EDITION
3389-13248-0023 LITERARY AND RELIGIOUS ITEMS TO THIRTY OR FORTY PAGES OF SPORT THEATRE GOSSIP FASHION SOCIETY AND POLITICAL MATERIAL THIS MADE A VERY INTERESTING MAGAZINE OF ALL SORTS OF READING MATTER AND HAD ALWAYS BEEN WELCOMED BY ALL THE SUBSCRIBERS CHURCH MEMBERS AND ALL AS A SUNDAY MORNING NECESSITY
3389-13248-0024 AND THE WORKING MAN ESPECIALLY WHO WOULD NOT GO TO CHURCH ANY WAY
3389-13248-0025 EDWARD NORMAN COMMUNED HONESTLY WITH HIMSELF OVER THE SUBJECT TAKING EVERYTHING INTO ACCOUNT WOULD JESUS PROBABLY EDIT A SUNDAY MORNING PAPER NO MATTER WHETHER IT PAID THAT WAS NOT THE QUESTION
3389-13248-0026 BESIDES THE REGULAR SUBSCRIBERS HAD PAID FOR A SEVEN DAY PAPER
3389-13248-0027 HE WAS HONESTLY PERPLEXED BY THE QUESTION
3389-13248-0028 IT WAS A VERY UNUSUAL PROCEEDING BUT THEY ALL AGREED THAT THE PAPER WAS BEING RUN ON NEW PRINCIPLES ANYHOW AND THEY ALL WATCHED MISTER NORMAN CAREFULLY AS HE SPOKE
3389-13248-0029 I PROPOSE CERTAIN CHANGES WHICH I BELIEVE ARE NECESSARY
3389-13248-0030 I WISH TO STATE MY MOTIVE IN DOING WHAT I HAVE DONE
3389-13248-0031 I SHALL STATE IN THAT ISSUE MY REASONS FOR DISCONTINUING IN ORDER TO MAKE UP TO THE SUBSCRIBERS THE AMOUNT OF READING MATTER THEY MAY SUPPOSE THEMSELVES ENTITLED TO WE CAN ISSUE A DOUBLE NUMBER ON SATURDAY AS IS DONE BY MANY EVENING PAPERS THAT MAKE NO ATTEMPT AT A SUNDAY EDITION
3389-13248-0032 HAS BEEN DONE BY OUR SUNDAY MORNING PAPER I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT JESUS WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR IT IF HE WERE IN MY PLACE TODAY IT WILL OCCASION SOME TROUBLE TO ARRANGE THE DETAILS CAUSED BY THIS CHANGE WITH THE ADVERTISERS AND SUBSCRIBERS THAT IS FOR ME TO LOOK AFTER THE CHANGE ITSELF IS ONE THAT WILL TAKE PLACE
3389-13248-0033 SO FAR AS I CAN SEE THE LOSS WILL FALL ON MYSELF NEITHER THE REPORTERS NOR THE PRESSMEN NEED MAKE ANY PARTICULAR CHANGES IN THEIR PLANS HE LOOKED AROUND THE ROOM AND NO ONE SPOKE
3389-13248-0034 WOULD JESUS DO THAT THAT IS WOULD HE PROBABLY RUN A NEWSPAPER ON SOME LOVING FAMILY PLAN
3389-13248-0035 HE CAUGHT HIMSELF DRAWING ALMOST AWAY FROM THE FACTS OF TYPOGRAPHICAL UNIONS AND
3389-13248-0036 AND ALL THE COLD BUSINESSLIKE METHODS THAT MAKE A GREAT DAILY SUCCESSFUL
3389-13248-0037 CLARK WAS A VERY VALUABLE MAN IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO FILL HIS PLACE BUT HE WAS NOT ABLE TO GIVE ANY REASONS FOR CONTINUING THE SUNDAY PAPER THAT ANSWERED THE QUESTION WHAT WOULD JESUS DO BY LETTING JESUS PRINT THAT EDITION
3389-13248-0038 WE MIGHT AS WELL FACE THAT FUTURE FACT I DON'T THINK WE SHALL WILL YOU STAY BY THE NEWS UNTIL IT IS BANKRUPT ASKED NORMAN WITH A STRANGE SMILE
