525-126965-0000 TO EFFECT AN ENTRANCE AND THEY CONSULTED ACCORDINGLY WHETHER THEY SHOULD KEEP SICILY ON THEIR RIGHT AND RISK SAILING IN BY SEA
525-126965-0001 THAT MIGHT AGREE TO JOIN THEM GO TO SYRACUSE BY LAND FINALLY THEY DETERMINED TO SAIL FOR HIMERA
525-126965-0002 AND THEY SENT AND APPOINTED A PLACE FOR THE SELINUNTINES TO MEET THEM WITH ALL THEIR FORCES A FEW TROOPS WERE ALSO PROMISED BY THE GELOANS AND SOME OF THE SICELS
525-126965-0003 OWING TO THE RECENT DEATH OF ARCHONIDAS A POWERFUL SICEL KING IN THAT NEIGHBOURHOOD AND FRIENDLY TO ATHENS AND OWING ALSO TO THE VIGOUR SHOWN
525-126965-0004 SOME LIGHT TROOPS AND CAVALRY FROM SELINUS A FEW GELOANS AND SICELS NUMBERING A THOUSAND IN ALL AND SET OUT ON HIS MARCH FOR SYRACUSE
525-126965-0005 MADE ALL HASTE TO ARRIVE AND ONE OF THEIR COMMANDERS GONGYLUS STARTING LAST WITH A SINGLE SHIP WAS THE FIRST TO REACH SYRACUSE A LITTLE BEFORE GYLIPPUS GONGYLUS FOUND THE SYRACUSANS ON THE POINT OF HOLDING AN ASSEMBLY TO CONSIDER WHETHER THEY
525-126965-0006 SHOULD PUT AN END TO THE WAR THIS HE PREVENTED AND REASSURED THEM BY TELLING THEM THAT MORE VESSELS WERE STILL TO ARRIVE AND THAT GYLIPPUS SON OF CLEANDRIDAS HAD BEEN DISPATCHED BY THE LACEDAEMONIANS TO TAKE THE COMMAND
525-126965-0007 HIS ARRIVAL CHANCED AT A CRITICAL MOMENT THE ATHENIANS HAD ALREADY FINISHED A DOUBLE WALL OF SIX OR SEVEN FURLONGS TO THE GREAT HARBOUR WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A SMALL PORTION
525-126965-0008 MEANWHILE THE ATHENIANS RECOVERING FROM THE CONFUSION INTO WHICH THEY HAD
525-126965-0009 OF GYLIPPUS AND THE SYRACUSANS FORMED IN ORDER OF BATTLE GYLIPPUS HALTED AT A SHORT DISTANCE OFF AND SENT ON A HERALD TO TELL THEM THAT IF THEY WOULD EVACUATE SICILY WITH BAG AND BAGGAGE WITHIN FIVE DAYS TIME HE WAS WILLING TO MAKE A TRUCE ACCORDINGLY
525-126965-0010 THE ATHENIANS TREATED THIS PROPOSITION WITH CONTEMPT AND DISMISSED THE HERALD WITHOUT AN ANSWER AFTER THIS BOTH SIDES BEGAN TO PREPARE FOR ACTION GYLIPPUS OBSERVING THAT THE SYRACUSANS WERE IN DISORDER AND DID NOT EASILY FALL INTO LINE
525-126965-0011 AND PASSED THE NIGHT THERE ON THE FOLLOWING DAY HE LED OUT THE MAIN BODY OF HIS ARMY AND DRAWING THEM UP IN ORDER OF BATTLE BEFORE THE WALLS OF THE ATHENIANS TO PREVENT THEIR GOING TO THE RELIEF OF ANY OTHER QUARTER DISPATCHED A STRONG FORCE AGAINST FORT LABDALUM AND TOOK IT
525-126965-0012 TO THE SWORD THE PLACE NOT BEING WITHIN SIGHT OF THE ATHENIANS
525-126965-0013 GUARD AT THIS POINT THEMSELVES DISPOSING THEIR CONFEDERATES ALONG THE REMAINDER OF THE WORKS
525-126965-0014 TO PUT OUT AGAINST THEM FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE GREAT HARBOUR BESIDES THIS HE NOW BEGAN TO PAY MORE ATTENTION TO THE WAR BY SEA SEEING THAT THE COMING OF GYLIPPUS HAD DIMINISHED THEIR HOPES BY LAND
525-126965-0015 THIS WAS THE FIRST AND CHIEF OCCASION OF THE LOSSES WHICH THE CREWS EXPERIENCED THE WATER WHICH THEY USED WAS SCARCE AND HAD TO BE FETCHED FROM FAR
525-126965-0016 TO PREVENT PLUNDERING INCURSIONS ON THE PART OF THE ATHENIANS AT PLEMMYRIUM
525-126965-0017 ON THE LOOK OUT FOR THEM ABOUT LOCRIS AND RHEGIUM AND THE APPROACH TO SICILY GYLIPPUS MEANWHILE WENT ON WITH THE WALL ACROSS EPIPOLAE USING THE STONES WHICH THE ATHENIANS HAD LAID DOWN
525-126965-0018 AND A HAND TO HAND FIGHT ENSUED BETWEEN THE LINES WHERE THE SYRACUSAN CAVALRY COULD BE OF NO USE AND THE SYRACUSANS AND THEIR ALLIES WERE DEFEATED AND TOOK UP THEIR DEAD UNDER TRUCE WHILE THE ATHENIANS ERECTED A TROPHY
525-126965-0019 WHILE WITH RESPECT TO MORAL ADVANTAGES IT WERE INTOLERABLE
525-126965-0020 AND ISLANDERS WITH THE MOTLEY RABBLE THAT ACCOMPANIED THEM AND OF DRIVING THEM OUT OF THE COUNTRY AFTER THIS HE EMBRACED THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY THAT OFFERED OF AGAIN LEADING THEM AGAINST THE ENEMY
525-126965-0021 NOW NICIAS AND THE ATHENIANS HELD THE OPINION THAT EVEN IF THE SYRACUSANS SHOULD NOT WISH TO OFFER BATTLE IT WAS NECESSARY FOR THEM TO PREVENT THE BUILDING OF THE CROSS WALL AS IT ALREADY
525-126965-0022 GYLIPPUS LED OUT HIS HEAVY INFANTRY FURTHER FROM THE FORTIFICATIONS THAN ON THE FORMER OCCASION AND SO JOINED BATTLE POSTING HIS HORSE AND DARTERS UPON THE FLANK OF THE ATHENIANS IN THE OPEN SPACE WHERE THE WORKS OF THE TWO WALLS TERMINATED DURING THE ENGAGEMENT
525-126965-0023 THE CAVALRY ATTACKED AND ROUTED THE LEFT WING OF THE ATHENIANS
525-126965-0024 AND DRIVEN HEADLONG WITHIN THEIR LINES THE NIGHT FOLLOWING THE SYRACUSANS CARRIED THEIR WALL UP TO THE ATHENIAN WORKS AND PASSED THEM THUS PUTTING IT OUT OF THEIR POWER ANY LONGER TO STOP THEM AND DEPRIVING THEM EVEN IF VICTORIOUS IN THE FIELD
525-126965-0025 AFTER THIS THE REMAINING TWELVE VESSELS OF THE CORINTHIANS AMBRACIOTS AND LEUCADIANS SAILED INTO THE HARBOUR UNDER THE COMMAND
525-126965-0026 IN ANY WAY THAT MIGHT OFFER EITHER IN MERCHANT VESSELS OR TRANSPORTS OR IN ANY OTHER MANNER LIKELY TO PROVE SUCCESSFUL
525-126965-0027 FOR REINFORCEMENTS WHILE THE SYRACUSANS PROCEEDED TO MAN A FLEET AND TO EXERCISE MEANING TO TRY THEIR FORTUNE IN THIS WAY ALSO AND GENERALLY BECAME EXCEEDINGLY CONFIDENT NICIAS PERCEIVING THIS AND SEEING THE STRENGTH OF THE ENEMY AND HIS OWN DIFFICULTIES DAILY INCREASING
525-126965-0028 HIMSELF ALSO SENT TO ATHENS HE HAD BEFORE SENT FREQUENT REPORTS OF EVENTS AS THEY OCCURRED AND FELT IT ESPECIALLY INCUMBENT UPON HIM TO DO SO NOW AS HE THOUGHT THAT THEY WERE IN A CRITICAL POSITION AND THAT UNLESS SPEEDILY RECALLED
525-126965-0029 OR STRONGLY REINFORCED FROM HOME THEY HAD NO HOPE OF SAFETY HE FEARED HOWEVER THAT THE MESSENGERS EITHER THROUGH INABILITY TO SPEAK OR THROUGH FAILURE OF MEMORY OR FROM A WISH TO PLEASE THE MULTITUDE MIGHT NOT REPORT THE TRUTH
525-126965-0030 WITHOUT ITS BEING LOST IN TRANSMISSION AND BE ABLE TO DECIDE UPON THE REAL FACTS OF THE CASE HIS EMISSARIES ACCORDINGLY DEPARTED WITH THE LETTER AND THE REQUISITE VERBAL INSTRUCTIONS AND HE ATTENDED TO THE AFFAIRS OF THE ARMY
525-126965-0031 MAKING IT HIS AIM NOW TO KEEP ON THE DEFENSIVE AND TO AVOID ANY UNNECESSARY DANGER
525-126965-0032 WHEN GYLIPPUS ARRIVED FROM LACEDAEMON WITH AN ARMY OBTAINED FROM PELOPONNESE AND FROM SOME OF THE CITIES IN SICILY IN OUR FIRST BATTLE WITH HIM WE WERE VICTORIOUS IN THE BATTLE ON THE FOLLOWING DAY WE WERE OVERPOWERED BY A MULTITUDE OF CAVALRY AND DARTERS AND COMPELLED TO RETIRE WITHIN OUR LINES
525-126965-0033 WE HAVE NOW THEREFORE BEEN FORCED BY THE NUMBERS OF THOSE OPPOSED TO US TO DISCONTINUE THE WORK OF CIRCUMVALLATION AND TO REMAIN INACTIVE BEING UNABLE TO MAKE USE EVEN OF ALL THE FORCE WE HAVE SINCE A LARGE PORTION OF OUR HEAVY INFANTRY
525-126965-0034 AS WE ARE PREVENTED BY THEIR CAVALRY FROM EVEN GOING FOR ANY DISTANCE INTO THE COUNTRY BESIDES THIS AN EMBASSY HAS BEEN DISPATCHED TO PELOPONNESE TO PROCURE REINFORCEMENTS AND GYLIPPUS HAS GONE TO THE CITIES IN SICILY
525-126965-0035 FOR I UNDERSTAND THAT THEY CONTEMPLATE A COMBINED ATTACK UPON OUR LINES WITH THEIR LAND FORCES AND WITH THEIR FLEET BY SEA YOU MUST NONE OF YOU BE SURPRISED THAT I SAY BY SEA ALSO
525-126965-0036 INDEED THEY MAY BE SEEN EXERCISING AND IT LIES WITH THEM TO TAKE THE INITIATIVE AND NOT HAVING TO MAINTAIN A BLOCKADE THEY HAVE GREATER FACILITIES FOR DRYING THEIR SHIPS
525-126965-0037 OF EXHAUSTING ALL OUR STRENGTH UPON THE BLOCKADE
525-126965-0038 IT WOULD BECOME IMPOSSIBLE THE LOSSES WHICH OUR CREWS HAVE SUFFERED AND STILL CONTINUE TO SUFFER ARISE FROM THE FOLLOWING CAUSES
525-126965-0039 SYRACUSAN CAVALRY THE LOSS OF OUR PREVIOUS SUPERIORITY EMBOLDENS OUR SLAVES TO DESERT OUR FOREIGN SEAMEN ARE IMPRESSED BY THE UNEXPECTED APPEARANCE OF A NAVY AGAINST US
525-126965-0040 TAKE THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY OF DEPARTING TO THEIR RESPECTIVE CITIES
525-126965-0041 OR OTHER OF THE VARIOUS FACILITIES OF ESCAPE WHICH THE MAGNITUDE OF SICILY AFFORDS THEM SOME EVEN ENGAGE IN TRADE THEMSELVES AND PREVAIL UPON THE CAPTAINS TO TAKE HYCCARIC SLAVES ON BOARD IN THEIR PLACE
525-126965-0042 THUS THEY HAVE RUINED THE EFFICIENCY OF OUR NAVY NOW I NEED NOT REMIND YOU THAT THE TIME DURING WHICH A CREW IS IN ITS PRIME IS SHORT AND THAT THE NUMBER OF SAILORS WHO CAN START A SHIP ON HER WAY AND KEEP THE ROWING IN TIME IS SMALL
525-126965-0043 BUT ARE COMPELLED TO DEPEND BOTH FOR SUPPLYING THE CREWS IN SERVICE
525-126965-0044 FOR OUR PRESENT CONFEDERATES NAXOS AND CATANA ARE INCAPABLE OF SUPPLYING US THERE IS ONLY ONE THING MORE WANTING TO OUR OPPONENTS I MEAN THE DEFECTION OF OUR ITALIAN MARKETS IF THEY WERE TO SEE YOU NEGLECT TO RELIEVE US FROM OUR PRESENT CONDITION
525-126965-0045 IF IT IS DESIRABLE FOR YOU TO KNOW THE REAL STATE OF THINGS HERE BEFORE TAKING YOUR MEASURES
525-126965-0046 TO BE TOLD THE BEST SIDE OF THINGS AND THEN TO BLAME THE TELLER IF THE EXPECTATIONS WHICH HE HAS RAISED IN YOUR MINDS ARE NOT ANSWERED BY THE RESULT AND I THEREFORE THOUGHT IT SAFEST TO DECLARE TO YOU THE TRUTH
525-126965-0047 WITH A LARGE SUM OF MONEY AND SOMEONE TO SUCCEED ME AS A DISEASE IN THE KIDNEYS UNFITS ME FOR RETAINING MY POST I HAVE I THINK SOME CLAIM ON YOUR INDULGENCE
525-126965-0048 AS THE ENEMY WILL OBTAIN HIS SICILIAN REINFORCEMENTS SHORTLY THOSE FROM PELOPONNESE AFTER A LONGER INTERVAL AND UNLESS YOU ATTEND TO THE MATTER THE FORMER WILL BE HERE BEFORE YOU WHILE THE LATTER WILL ELUDE YOU AS THEY HAVE DONE BEFORE SUCH WERE THE
525-126965-0049 WHEN THE ATHENIANS HAD HEARD IT THEY REFUSED TO ACCEPT HIS RESIGNATION BUT CHOSE HIM TWO COLLEAGUES
525-126965-0050 THEY ALSO VOTED TO SEND OUT ANOTHER ARMY AND NAVY DRAWN PARTLY FROM THE ATHENIANS ON THE MUSTER ROLL PARTLY FROM THE ALLIES
525-126965-0051 WITH TEN SHIPS A HUNDRED AND TWENTY TALENTS OF SILVER AND INSTRUCTIONS TO TELL THE ARMY THAT REINFORCEMENTS WOULD ARRIVE AND THAT CARE WOULD BE TAKEN OF THEM
525-126965-0052 AND SENT FOR TROOPS TO THE ALLIES AND MEANWHILE GOT TOGETHER MONEY SHIPS AND HEAVY INFANTRY AT HOME THE ATHENIANS ALSO SENT TWENTY VESSELS ROUND PELOPONNESE TO PREVENT ANY ONE CROSSING OVER TO SICILY FROM CORINTH OR PELOPONNESE
525-126965-0053 HAD NOT BEEN WITHOUT ITS USE WERE NOW PREPARING TO DISPATCH A FORCE OF HEAVY INFANTRY
525-126965-0054 AND AT THE INSTIGATION OF THE SYRACUSANS AND CORINTHIANS WHO WISHED FOR AN INVASION TO ARREST THE REINFORCEMENTS
525-126965-0055 AND A VIGOROUS PROSECUTION OF THE WAR BUT THE LACEDAEMONIANS DERIVED MOST ENCOURAGEMENT FROM THE BELIEF THAT ATHENS WITH TWO WARS ON HER HANDS
525-126965-0056 WOULD BE MORE EASY TO SUBDUE AND FROM THE CONVICTION THAT SHE HAD BEEN THE FIRST TO INFRINGE THE TRUCE IN THE FORMER WAR THEY CONSIDERED THE OFFENCE HAD BEEN MORE ON THEIR OWN SIDE BOTH ON ACCOUNT OF THE ENTRANCE OF THE THEBANS
525-126965-0057 AND WHATEVER ELSE HAD BEFALLEN THEM BUT WHEN BESIDES THE RAVAGES FROM PYLOS WHICH WENT ON WITHOUT ANY INTERMISSION THE THIRTY ATHENIAN SHIPS CAME OUT FROM ARGOS AND WASTED PART OF EPIDAURUS
525-126965-0058 WHEN UPON EVERY DISPUTE THAT AROSE AS TO THE INTERPRETATION OF ANY DOUBTFUL POINT IN THE TREATY THEIR OWN OFFERS OF ARBITRATION WERE ALWAYS REJECTED BY THE ATHENIANS THE LACEDAEMONIANS AT LENGTH DECIDED THAT ATHENS HAD NOW COMMITTED THE VERY SAME OFFENCE
525-126965-0059 KING OF THE LACEDAEMONIANS THEY BEGAN BY DEVASTATING THE PARTS BORDERING UPON THE PLAIN AND NEXT PROCEEDED
525-126965-0060 THEIR COUNTRYMEN AT HOME SENT OFF AT ABOUT THE SAME TIME THE HEAVY INFANTRY IN THE MERCHANT VESSELS TO SICILY THE LACEDAEMONIANS FURNISHING A PICKED FORCE OF HELOTS AND
525-126965-0061 OR FREEDMEN SIX HUNDRED HEAVY INFANTRY IN ALL UNDER THE COMMAND OF ECCRITUS
525-126965-0062 THE SICYONIANS ALSO SENT OFF TWO HUNDRED HEAVY INFANTRY AT SAME TIME AS THE CORINTHIANS UNDER THE COMMAND OF SARGEUS A SICYONIAN
525-126965-0063 THUS FULFILLING THE OBJECT FOR WHICH THEY HAD BEEN MANNED ORIGINALLY WHICH WAS TO DIVERT THE ATTENTION OF THE ATHENIANS FROM THE MERCHANTMEN TO THE GALLEYS
525-126965-0064 AT THE SAME TIME THEY DISPATCHED DEMOSTHENES TO SICILY AS THEY HAD INTENDED
525-126965-0065 AND ACCORDINGLY SAILED TO AEGINA AND THERE WAITED FOR THE REMAINDER OF HIS ARMAMENT AND FOR CHARICLES TO FETCH THE ARGIVE TROOPS IN SICILY ABOUT THE SAME TIME IN THIS SPRING GYLIPPUS CAME TO SYRACUSE WITH AS MANY TROOPS AS HE COULD BRING FROM THE CITIES
525-126965-0066 CALLING THE SYRACUSANS TOGETHER HE TOLD THEM THAT THEY MUST MAN AS MANY SHIPS AS POSSIBLE
525-126965-0067 BY WHICH HE HOPED TO ACHIEVE AN ADVANTAGE IN THE WAR NOT UNWORTHY OF THE RISK WITH HIM HERMOCRATES ACTIVELY JOINED IN TRYING TO ENCOURAGE HIS COUNTRYMEN TO ATTACK THE ATHENIANS AT SEA
525-126965-0068 SAYING THAT THE LATTER HAD NOT INHERITED THEIR NAVAL PROWESS NOR WOULD THEY RETAIN IT FOR EVER
525-126965-0069 UPON THEIR INEXPERIENCE HE ACCORDINGLY URGED THEM TO THROW ASIDE THEIR FEARS AND TO TRY THEIR FORTUNE AT SEA AND THE SYRACUSANS UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF GYLIPPUS AND HERMOCRATES AND PERHAPS SOME OTHERS MADE UP THEIR MINDS FOR THE SEA FIGHT AND BEGAN TO MAN THEIR VESSELS
525-126965-0070 WHEN THE FLEET WAS READY GYLIPPUS LED OUT THE WHOLE ARMY BY NIGHT HIS PLAN BEING TO ASSAULT IN PERSON THE FORTS ON PLEMMYRIUM BY LAND WHILE THIRTY FIVE SYRACUSAN GALLEYS SAILED ACCORDING TO APPOINTMENT AGAINST THE ENEMY FROM THE GREAT HARBOUR
525-126965-0071 THE ATHENIANS QUICKLY MANNED SIXTY SHIPS AND WITH TWENTY FIVE OF THESE ENGAGED THE THIRTY FIVE OF THE SYRACUSANS IN THE GREAT HARBOUR SENDING THE REST TO MEET THOSE SAILING ROUND FROM THE ARSENAL
525-126965-0072 MAINTAINED WITH EQUAL TENACITY ON BOTH SIDES
525-126965-0073 SEEING THE LARGEST SO EASILY TAKEN AT THE FALL OF THE FIRST FORT THE MEN FROM IT WHO SUCCEEDED IN TAKING REFUGE IN THEIR BOATS AND MERCHANTMEN FOUND GREAT DIFFICULTY IN REACHING THE CAMP AS THE SYRACUSANS
525-126965-0074 WERE HAVING THE BEST OF IT IN THE ENGAGEMENT IN THE GREAT HARBOUR AND SENT A FAST SAILING GALLEY TO PURSUE THEM
525-126965-0075 WITH MORE EASE THE SYRACUSAN SHIPS FIGHTING OFF THE MOUTH OF THE HARBOUR FORCED THEIR WAY THROUGH THE ATHENIAN VESSELS AND SAILING IN WITHOUT ANY ORDER FELL FOUL OF ONE ANOTHER AND TRANSFERRED THE VICTORY TO THE ATHENIANS
525-126965-0076 WHO NOT ONLY ROUTED THE SQUADRON IN QUESTION BUT ALSO THAT BY WHICH THEY WERE AT FIRST BEING DEFEATED IN THE HARBOUR SINKING ELEVEN OF THE SYRACUSAN VESSELS AND KILLING MOST OF THE MEN EXCEPT THE CREWS OF THREE SHIPS WHOM THEY MADE PRISONERS
525-126965-0077 THEIR OWN LOSS WAS CONFINED TO THREE VESSELS AND AFTER HAULING ASHORE THE SYRACUSAN WRECKS AND SETTING UP A TROPHY UPON THE
525-126965-0078 THEY RAZED BUT PUT IN ORDER AND GARRISONED THE TWO OTHERS IN THE CAPTURE OF THE FORTS A GREAT MANY MEN WERE KILLED AND MADE PRISONERS AND A GREAT QUANTITY OF PROPERTY WAS TAKEN IN ALL
525-126965-0079 AS THE ATHENIANS HAD USED THEM AS A MAGAZINE THERE WAS A LARGE STOCK OF GOODS AND CORN OF THE MERCHANTS INSIDE AND ALSO A LARGE STOCK BELONGING TO THE CAPTAINS THE MASTS AND OTHER FURNITURE OF FORTY GALLEYS BEING TAKEN BESIDES THREE GALLEYS WHICH HAD BEEN DRAWN UP ON SHORE
525-126965-0080 AND NOTHING COULD BE BROUGHT IN WITHOUT FIGHTING BESIDES THE GENERAL IMPRESSION OF DISMAY AND DISCOURAGEMENT PRODUCED UPON THE ARMY AFTER THIS THE SYRACUSANS SENT OUT TWELVE SHIPS UNDER THE COMMAND OF AGATHARCHUS A SYRACUSAN
525-126965-0081 ONE OF THESE WENT TO PELOPONNESE WITH AMBASSADORS TO DESCRIBE THE HOPEFUL STATE OF THEIR AFFAIRS AND TO INCITE THE PELOPONNESIANS TO PROSECUTE THE WAR THERE
525-126965-0082 WHILE THE ELEVEN OTHERS SAILED TO ITALY HEARING THAT VESSELS LADEN
525-126965-0083 TERRITORY A QUANTITY OF TIMBER FOR SHIPBUILDING WHICH HAD
525-126965-0084 WENT TO LOCRI AND ONE OF THE MERCHANTMEN FROM PELOPONNESE COMING IN WHILE THEY WERE AT ANCHOR THERE CARRYING THESPIAN HEAVY INFANTRY TOOK THESE ON BOARD AND SAILED ALONGSHORE TOWARDS HOME
525-126965-0085 THE ATHENIANS WERE ON THE LOOK OUT FOR THEM WITH TWENTY SHIPS AT MEGARA BUT WERE ONLY ABLE TO TAKE ONE VESSEL WITH ITS CREW THE REST GETTING CLEAR OFF TO SYRACUSE
525-126965-0086 THE ATHENIANS BROUGHT UP TO THEM A SHIP OF TEN THOUSAND TALENTS BURDEN FURNISHED WITH WOODEN TURRETS AND SCREENS AND FASTENED ROPES ROUND THE PILES FROM THEIR BOATS WRENCHED THEM UP AND BROKE THEM OR DIVED DOWN AND SAWED THEM IN TWO
525-126965-0087 MEANWHILE THE SYRACUSANS PLIED THEM WITH MISSILES FROM THE DOCKS
525-126965-0088 SO THAT IT WAS DANGEROUS TO SAIL UP FOR FEAR OF RUNNING THE SHIPS UPON THEM JUST AS UPON A REEF THROUGH NOT SEEING THEM HOWEVER DIVERS WENT DOWN AND SAWED OFF EVEN THESE FOR REWARD ALTHOUGH THE SYRACUSANS DROVE IN OTHERS
525-126965-0089 INDEED THERE WAS NO END TO THE CONTRIVANCES TO WHICH THEY RESORTED AGAINST EACH OTHER AS MIGHT BE EXPECTED BETWEEN TWO HOSTILE ARMIES CONFRONTING EACH OTHER AT SUCH A SHORT DISTANCE AND SKIRMISHES AND ALL KINDS OF OTHER ATTEMPTS WERE OF CONSTANT OCCURRENCE
525-126965-0090 MEANWHILE THE SYRACUSANS SENT EMBASSIES TO THE CITIES COMPOSED OF CORINTHIANS AMBRACIOTS AND LACEDAEMONIANS
525-126965-0091 THAN TO THEIR OWN DISORDER AND GENERALLY
525-126965-0092 AS THE ATHENIANS WERE EXPECTED WITH A FRESH ARMY AND IF THE ONE ALREADY THERE COULD BE DESTROYED BEFORE THE OTHER ARRIVED THE WAR WOULD BE AT AN END WHILE THE CONTENDING PARTIES IN SICILY WERE THUS ENGAGED DEMOSTHENES HAVING NOW GOT TOGETHER
525-126965-0093 THE ARMAMENT WITH WHICH HE WAS TO GO TO THE ISLAND
525-126965-0094 A SORT OF ISTHMUS TO WHICH THE HELOTS
525-126965-0095 AND SO TO PROCEED WITHOUT DELAY TO SICILY WHILE CHARICLES WAITED UNTIL HE HAD COMPLETED THE FORTIFICATION OF THE PLACE AND LEAVING A GARRISON THERE RETURNED HOME SUBSEQUENTLY WITH HIS THIRTY SHIPS AND THE ARGIVES ALSO
525-126965-0096 THIS SAME SUMMER ARRIVED AT ATHENS THIRTEEN HUNDRED TARGETEERS THRACIAN SWORDSMEN OF THE TRIBE OF THE DII WHO WERE TO HAVE SAILED TO SICILY WITH DEMOSTHENES SINCE THEY HAD COME TOO LATE THE ATHENIANS DETERMINED TO SEND THEM BACK TO THRACE WHENCE THEY HAD COME
525-126965-0097 TOO EXPENSIVE AS THE PAY OF EACH MAN WAS A DRACHMA A DAY
525-126965-0098 REST OF THE TIME THE ENEMY WAS NOW PERMANENTLY FIXED IN ATTICA AT ONE TIME IT WAS AN ATTACK IN FORCE AT ANOTHER IT WAS THE REGULAR GARRISON
525-126965-0099 WAS IN THE FIELD AND DILIGENTLY PROSECUTING THE WAR GREAT MISCHIEF WAS THEREFORE DONE TO THE ATHENIANS THEY WERE DEPRIVED OF THEIR WHOLE COUNTRY MORE THAN TWENTY THOUSAND SLAVES HAD DESERTED A GREAT PART OF THEM ARTISANS AND ALL THEIR SHEEP AND BEASTS OF BURDEN WERE LOST
525-126965-0100 AND TO GUARD THE COUNTRY THEIR HORSES WERE EITHER LAMED BY BEING CONSTANTLY WORKED UPON ROCKY GROUND OR WOUNDED BY THE ENEMY
525-126965-0101 THE CAVALRY EXCEPTED AT THE DIFFERENT MILITARY POSTS OR UPON THE WALL BUT WHAT
525-126965-0102 WHICH NO ONE WOULD HAVE BELIEVED POSSIBLE IF HE HAD HEARD OF IT BEFORE IT HAD COME TO PASS FOR COULD ANY ONE HAVE IMAGINED THAT EVEN WHEN BESIEGED BY THE PELOPONNESIANS ENTRENCHED IN ATTICA THEY WOULD STILL INSTEAD OF WITHDRAWING FROM SICILY
525-126965-0103 STAY ON THERE BESIEGING IN LIKE MANNER SYRACUSE A TOWN TAKEN AS A TOWN IN NO WAY INFERIOR TO ATHENS OR WOULD SO THOROUGHLY UPSET THE HELLENIC ESTIMATE OF THEIR STRENGTH AND AUDACITY AS TO GIVE THE SPECTACLE OF A PEOPLE WHICH AT THE BEGINNING OF THE WAR
525-126965-0104 SOME THOUGHT MIGHT HOLD OUT ONE YEAR SOME TWO NONE MORE THAN THREE IF THE PELOPONNESIANS INVADED THEIR COUNTRY NOW SEVENTEEN YEARS AFTER THE FIRST INVASION AFTER HAVING ALREADY SUFFERED FROM ALL THE EVILS OF WAR
525-126965-0105 GOING TO SICILY AND UNDERTAKING A NEW WAR NOTHING INFERIOR TO THAT WHICH THEY ALREADY HAD WITH THE PELOPONNESIANS THESE CAUSES
525-126965-0106 PRODUCED THEIR FINANCIAL EMBARRASSMENT AND IT WAS AT THIS TIME THAT THEY IMPOSED UPON THEIR SUBJECTS INSTEAD OF THE TRIBUTE THE TAX OF A TWENTIETH UPON ALL IMPORTS AND EXPORTS BY SEA WHICH THEY THOUGHT WOULD BRING THEM IN MORE MONEY THEIR EXPENDITURE BEING NOW
525-126965-0107 NOT THE SAME AS AT FIRST BUT HAVING GROWN WITH THE WAR WHILE THEIR REVENUES DECAYED ACCORDINGLY NOT WISHING TO INCUR EXPENSE IN THEIR PRESENT WANT OF MONEY THEY SENT BACK AT ONCE THE THRACIANS WHO CAME TOO LATE FOR DEMOSTHENES
525-126965-0108 TO MAKE USE OF THEM IF POSSIBLE IN THE VOYAGE ALONGSHORE TO INJURE THE ENEMY
525-126965-0109 LED THEM AGAINST MYCALESSUS THE NIGHT HE PASSED UNOBSERVED NEAR THE TEMPLE OF HERMES NOT QUITE TWO MILES FROM MYCALESSUS AND AT DAYBREAK ASSAULTED AND TOOK THE TOWN WHICH IS NOT A LARGE ONE THE INHABITANTS BEING OFF THEIR GUARD AND NOT EXPECTING THAT ANY ONE WOULD EVER COME UP
525-126965-0110 AND UNAPPROACHED BY ANY IN SUDDENNESS AND IN HORROR
525-126965-0111 WHERE THE VESSELS WHICH BROUGHT THEM WERE LYING THE GREATEST SLAUGHTER TOOK PLACE WHILE THEY WERE EMBARKING AS THEY DID NOT KNOW HOW TO SWIM AND THOSE IN THE VESSELS ON SEEING
525-126965-0112 A GOOD NUMBER WHO WERE AFTER PLUNDER WERE ACTUALLY CAUGHT IN THE TOWN AND PUT TO DEATH ALTOGETHER THE THRACIANS HAD TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY KILLED OUT OF THIRTEEN HUNDRED
525-126965-0113 BOEOTARCHS THE MYCALESSIANS LOST A LARGE PROPORTION OF THEIR POPULATION WHILE MYCALESSUS THUS EXPERIENCED A CALAMITY FOR ITS EXTENT AS LAMENTABLE AS ANY THAT HAPPENED IN THE WAR
525-126965-0114 AFTER THIS ARRIVING AT ZACYNTHUS AND CEPHALLENIA HE TOOK A BODY OF HEAVY INFANTRY ON BOARD AND SENDING FOR SOME OF THE MESSENIANS
525-126965-0115 TO ALYZIA AND TO ANACTORIUM
525-126965-0116 DURING THE WINTER WITH THE MONEY FOR THE ARMY
525-126965-0117 HERE ALSO CONON CAME TO THEM THE COMMANDER AT NAUPACTUS WITH NEWS THAT THE TWENTY FIVE CORINTHIAN SHIPS STATIONED OPPOSITE TO HIM FAR FROM GIVING OVER THE WAR WERE MEDITATING AN ENGAGEMENT
525-126965-0118 DEMOSTHENES AND EURYMEDON ACCORDINGLY SENT TEN OF THEIR BEST SAILERS WITH CONON
525-126965-0119 AND MEANWHILE PREPARED FOR THE MUSTER OF THEIR FORCES
525-126965-0120 WHO ESCAPED WERE CONDUCTED TO SYRACUSE ABOUT THE SAME TIME THE CAMARINAEANS ALSO CAME TO THE ASSISTANCE OF SYRACUSE WITH FIVE HUNDRED HEAVY INFANTRY THREE HUNDRED DARTERS AND AS MANY ARCHERS WHILE THE GELOANS SENT CREWS FOR FIVE SHIPS FOUR HUNDRED DARTERS AND TWO HUNDRED HORSE
525-126965-0121 INDEED ALMOST THE WHOLE OF SICILY EXCEPT THE AGRIGENTINES WHO WERE NEUTRAL NOW CEASED MERELY TO WATCH EVENTS AS IT HAD HITHERTO DONE AND ACTIVELY JOINED SYRACUSE AGAINST THE ATHENIANS WHILE THE SYRACUSANS AFTER THE SICEL DISASTER
525-126965-0122 PUT OFF ANY IMMEDIATE ATTACK UPON THE ATHENIANS DEMOSTHENES AND EURYMEDON
525-126965-0123 PROMONTORY AND STARTING FROM THENCE
525-126965-0124 WHERE THEY TOOK ON BOARD A HUNDRED AND FIFTY
525-126965-0125 WHO HAD FURNISHED THEM WITH THE DARTERS ARRIVED AT METAPONTIUM IN ITALY HERE THEY PERSUADED THEIR ALLIES THE METAPONTINES TO SEND WITH THEM THREE HUNDRED DARTERS AND TWO GALLEYS AND WITH THIS REINFORCEMENT COASTED ON TO THURII
525-126965-0126 WHERE THEY FOUND THE PARTY HOSTILE TO ATHENS RECENTLY EXPELLED
525-126965-0127 AND ACCORDINGLY REMAINED THERE TO MUSTER AND REVIEW THE WHOLE ARMY TO SEE IF ANY HAD BEEN LEFT BEHIND AND TO PREVAIL UPON THE THURIANS RESOLUTELY TO JOIN THEM IN THEIR EXPEDITION
525-126965-0128 TO SICILY HAD GOT READY FOR ENGAGING AND MANNING SOME ADDITIONAL VESSELS SO AS TO BE NUMERICALLY LITTLE INFERIOR
525-126965-0129 THE PLACE OFF WHICH THEY LAY BEING IN THE FORM OF A CRESCENT THE LAND FORCES FURNISHED BY THE CORINTHIANS AND THEIR ALLIES ON THE SPOT CAME UP AND RANGED THEMSELVES UPON THE PROJECTING HEADLANDS ON EITHER SIDE WHILE THE FLEET
525-126965-0130 A CORINTHIAN HELD THE INTERVENING SPACE AND BLOCKED UP THE ENTRANCE THE ATHENIANS UNDER DIPHILUS NOW SAILED OUT AGAINST THEM WITH THIRTY THREE SHIPS FROM NAUPACTUS AND THE CORINTHIANS
525-126965-0131 WHOSE CHEEKS HAD BEEN STRENGTHENED FOR THIS VERY PURPOSE AFTER AN ACTION OF THIS EVEN CHARACTER IN WHICH EITHER PARTY COULD CLAIM THE VICTORY
525-126965-0132 THE CORINTHIANS NOT PUTTING OUT AGAIN TO MEET THEM THE TWO COMBATANTS PARTED NO PURSUIT TOOK PLACE AND NO PRISONERS WERE MADE ON EITHER SIDE
525-126965-0133 THE ATHENIANS NOW SAILED BACK TO NAUPACTUS AND THE CORINTHIANS IMMEDIATELY SET UP A TROPHY AS VICTORS BECAUSE THEY HAD DISABLED A GREATER NUMBER OF THE ENEMY'S SHIPS
525-126965-0134 ABOUT TWO MILES AND A QUARTER FROM ERINEUS THE CORINTHIAN STATION THIS WAS THE TERMINATION
525-126965-0135 IN ADDITION TO OTHER IMPROVEMENTS SUGGESTED BY THE FORMER SEA FIGHT WHICH THEY NOW ADOPTED IN THE EQUIPMENT OF THEIR NAVY THEY CUT DOWN THEIR PROWS TO A SMALLER COMPASS TO MAKE THEM MORE SOLID AND MADE THEIR CHEEKS STOUTER AND FROM THESE LET STAYS INTO THE VESSELS SIDES
525-126965-0136 IN THE SAME WAY AS THE CORINTHIANS HAD ALTERED THEIR PROWS BEFORE ENGAGING THE SQUADRON AT NAUPACTUS THE SYRACUSANS THOUGHT THAT THEY WOULD THUS HAVE AN ADVANTAGE OVER THE ATHENIAN VESSELS WHICH WERE NOT CONSTRUCTED WITH EQUAL STRENGTH BUT WERE SLIGHT IN THE BOWS
525-126965-0137 FROM THEIR BEING MORE USED TO SAIL ROUND AND CHARGE THE ENEMY'S SIDE THAN TO MEET HIM PROW TO PROW
525-126965-0138 WITH A GREAT MANY SHIPS IN NOT MUCH ROOM WAS ALSO A FACT IN THEIR FAVOUR CHARGING PROW TO PROW THEY WOULD STAVE IN THE ENEMY'S BOWS BY
525-126965-0139 AND SECONDLY THE ATHENIANS FOR WANT OF ROOM WOULD BE UNABLE TO USE THEIR FAVOURITE MANOEUVRE OF BREAKING THE LINE OR OF SAILING ROUND AS THE SYRACUSANS WOULD DO THEIR BEST NOT TO LET THEM DO THE ONE AND WANT OF ROOM WOULD PREVENT THEIR DOING THE OTHER
525-126965-0140 THIS CHARGING PROW TO PROW WHICH HAD HITHERTO BEEN THOUGHT WANT OF SKILL IN A HELMSMAN WOULD BE THE SYRACUSANS CHIEF MANOEUVRE AS BEING THAT WHICH THEY SHOULD FIND MOST USEFUL
525-126965-0141 AND THAT ONLY FOR A LITTLE WAY AND IN THE LITTLE SPACE IN FRONT OF THEIR OWN CAMP
525-126965-0142 AND THE ATHENIANS IF HARD PRESSED BY CROWDING TOGETHER IN A SMALL SPACE AND ALL TO THE SAME POINT WOULD RUN FOUL OF ONE ANOTHER
525-126965-0143 THEY NOT HAVING LIKE THE SYRACUSANS THE WHOLE HARBOUR TO RETREAT OVER
525-126965-0144 A LITTLE THE FIRST AND BROUGHT THEM UP TO THE WALL OF THE ATHENIANS
525-126965-0145 THAT IS TO SAY THE HEAVY INFANTRY THAT
525-126965-0146 AND ALLIES SAILING OUT IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS
525-126965-0147 RETIRING FROM THE LINES THE NEXT DAY THE SYRACUSANS REMAINED QUIET AND GAVE NO SIGNS OF WHAT THEY WERE GOING TO DO BUT NICIAS SEEING THAT THE BATTLE HAD BEEN A DRAWN ONE AND EXPECTING THAT THEY WOULD ATTACK AGAIN COMPELLED THE CAPTAINS TO REFIT ANY OF THE SHIPS THAT HAD SUFFERED
525-126965-0148 FROM EACH OTHER IN ORDER THAT ANY SHIP THAT WAS HARD PRESSED MIGHT BE ABLE TO RETREAT IN SAFETY AND SAIL OUT AGAIN AT LEISURE THESE PREPARATIONS OCCUPIED THE ATHENIANS ALL DAY UNTIL NIGHTFALL
525-126965-0149 TO SEND TO THE OFFICIALS IN THE CITY AND TELL THEM TO MOVE THE SALE MARKET AS QUICKLY AS THEY COULD DOWN TO THE SEA
525-126965-0150 AND SHORTLY AFTERWARDS THE SELFSAME DAY TO ATTACK THE ATHENIANS AGAIN WHEN THEY WERE NOT EXPECTING IT IN COMPLIANCE WITH THIS ADVICE A MESSENGER WAS SENT AND THE MARKET GOT READY UPON WHICH THE SYRACUSANS SUDDENLY BACKED WATER AND WITHDREW TO THE TOWN
525-126965-0151 SUDDENLY THE SYRACUSANS HAD MANNED THEIR SHIPS AND AGAIN SAILED AGAINST THEM AND THE ATHENIANS IN GREAT CONFUSION AND MOST OF THEM FASTING GOT ON BOARD AND WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY PUT OUT TO MEET THEM FOR SOME TIME BOTH PARTIES REMAINED ON THE DEFENSIVE WITHOUT ENGAGING
525-126965-0152 UNTIL THE ATHENIANS AT LAST RESOLVED NOT TO LET THEMSELVES BE WORN OUT BY WAITING WHERE THEY WERE BUT TO ATTACK WITHOUT DELAY AND GIVING A CHEER WENT INTO ACTION THE SYRACUSANS RECEIVED THEM AND CHARGING PROW TO PROW AS THEY HAD INTENDED
525-126965-0153 AND SAILED AGAINST THEIR SIDES AND DISCHARGED FROM THENCE THEIR DARTS UPON THE SAILORS
