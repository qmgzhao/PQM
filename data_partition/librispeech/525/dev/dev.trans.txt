525-126965-0062 THE SICYONIANS ALSO SENT OFF TWO HUNDRED HEAVY INFANTRY AT SAME TIME AS THE CORINTHIANS UNDER THE COMMAND OF SARGEUS A SICYONIAN
525-126965-0063 THUS FULFILLING THE OBJECT FOR WHICH THEY HAD BEEN MANNED ORIGINALLY WHICH WAS TO DIVERT THE ATTENTION OF THE ATHENIANS FROM THE MERCHANTMEN TO THE GALLEYS
525-126965-0064 AT THE SAME TIME THEY DISPATCHED DEMOSTHENES TO SICILY AS THEY HAD INTENDED
525-126965-0065 AND ACCORDINGLY SAILED TO AEGINA AND THERE WAITED FOR THE REMAINDER OF HIS ARMAMENT AND FOR CHARICLES TO FETCH THE ARGIVE TROOPS IN SICILY ABOUT THE SAME TIME IN THIS SPRING GYLIPPUS CAME TO SYRACUSE WITH AS MANY TROOPS AS HE COULD BRING FROM THE CITIES
525-126965-0066 CALLING THE SYRACUSANS TOGETHER HE TOLD THEM THAT THEY MUST MAN AS MANY SHIPS AS POSSIBLE
525-126965-0067 BY WHICH HE HOPED TO ACHIEVE AN ADVANTAGE IN THE WAR NOT UNWORTHY OF THE RISK WITH HIM HERMOCRATES ACTIVELY JOINED IN TRYING TO ENCOURAGE HIS COUNTRYMEN TO ATTACK THE ATHENIANS AT SEA
525-126965-0068 SAYING THAT THE LATTER HAD NOT INHERITED THEIR NAVAL PROWESS NOR WOULD THEY RETAIN IT FOR EVER
525-126965-0069 UPON THEIR INEXPERIENCE HE ACCORDINGLY URGED THEM TO THROW ASIDE THEIR FEARS AND TO TRY THEIR FORTUNE AT SEA AND THE SYRACUSANS UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF GYLIPPUS AND HERMOCRATES AND PERHAPS SOME OTHERS MADE UP THEIR MINDS FOR THE SEA FIGHT AND BEGAN TO MAN THEIR VESSELS
525-126965-0070 WHEN THE FLEET WAS READY GYLIPPUS LED OUT THE WHOLE ARMY BY NIGHT HIS PLAN BEING TO ASSAULT IN PERSON THE FORTS ON PLEMMYRIUM BY LAND WHILE THIRTY FIVE SYRACUSAN GALLEYS SAILED ACCORDING TO APPOINTMENT AGAINST THE ENEMY FROM THE GREAT HARBOUR
525-126965-0071 THE ATHENIANS QUICKLY MANNED SIXTY SHIPS AND WITH TWENTY FIVE OF THESE ENGAGED THE THIRTY FIVE OF THE SYRACUSANS IN THE GREAT HARBOUR SENDING THE REST TO MEET THOSE SAILING ROUND FROM THE ARSENAL
525-126965-0072 MAINTAINED WITH EQUAL TENACITY ON BOTH SIDES
525-126965-0073 SEEING THE LARGEST SO EASILY TAKEN AT THE FALL OF THE FIRST FORT THE MEN FROM IT WHO SUCCEEDED IN TAKING REFUGE IN THEIR BOATS AND MERCHANTMEN FOUND GREAT DIFFICULTY IN REACHING THE CAMP AS THE SYRACUSANS
525-126965-0074 WERE HAVING THE BEST OF IT IN THE ENGAGEMENT IN THE GREAT HARBOUR AND SENT A FAST SAILING GALLEY TO PURSUE THEM
525-126965-0075 WITH MORE EASE THE SYRACUSAN SHIPS FIGHTING OFF THE MOUTH OF THE HARBOUR FORCED THEIR WAY THROUGH THE ATHENIAN VESSELS AND SAILING IN WITHOUT ANY ORDER FELL FOUL OF ONE ANOTHER AND TRANSFERRED THE VICTORY TO THE ATHENIANS
525-126965-0076 WHO NOT ONLY ROUTED THE SQUADRON IN QUESTION BUT ALSO THAT BY WHICH THEY WERE AT FIRST BEING DEFEATED IN THE HARBOUR SINKING ELEVEN OF THE SYRACUSAN VESSELS AND KILLING MOST OF THE MEN EXCEPT THE CREWS OF THREE SHIPS WHOM THEY MADE PRISONERS
525-126965-0077 THEIR OWN LOSS WAS CONFINED TO THREE VESSELS AND AFTER HAULING ASHORE THE SYRACUSAN WRECKS AND SETTING UP A TROPHY UPON THE
525-126965-0078 THEY RAZED BUT PUT IN ORDER AND GARRISONED THE TWO OTHERS IN THE CAPTURE OF THE FORTS A GREAT MANY MEN WERE KILLED AND MADE PRISONERS AND A GREAT QUANTITY OF PROPERTY WAS TAKEN IN ALL
525-126965-0079 AS THE ATHENIANS HAD USED THEM AS A MAGAZINE THERE WAS A LARGE STOCK OF GOODS AND CORN OF THE MERCHANTS INSIDE AND ALSO A LARGE STOCK BELONGING TO THE CAPTAINS THE MASTS AND OTHER FURNITURE OF FORTY GALLEYS BEING TAKEN BESIDES THREE GALLEYS WHICH HAD BEEN DRAWN UP ON SHORE
525-126965-0080 AND NOTHING COULD BE BROUGHT IN WITHOUT FIGHTING BESIDES THE GENERAL IMPRESSION OF DISMAY AND DISCOURAGEMENT PRODUCED UPON THE ARMY AFTER THIS THE SYRACUSANS SENT OUT TWELVE SHIPS UNDER THE COMMAND OF AGATHARCHUS A SYRACUSAN
525-126965-0081 ONE OF THESE WENT TO PELOPONNESE WITH AMBASSADORS TO DESCRIBE THE HOPEFUL STATE OF THEIR AFFAIRS AND TO INCITE THE PELOPONNESIANS TO PROSECUTE THE WAR THERE
525-126965-0082 WHILE THE ELEVEN OTHERS SAILED TO ITALY HEARING THAT VESSELS LADEN
525-126965-0083 TERRITORY A QUANTITY OF TIMBER FOR SHIPBUILDING WHICH HAD
525-126965-0084 WENT TO LOCRI AND ONE OF THE MERCHANTMEN FROM PELOPONNESE COMING IN WHILE THEY WERE AT ANCHOR THERE CARRYING THESPIAN HEAVY INFANTRY TOOK THESE ON BOARD AND SAILED ALONGSHORE TOWARDS HOME
525-126965-0085 THE ATHENIANS WERE ON THE LOOK OUT FOR THEM WITH TWENTY SHIPS AT MEGARA BUT WERE ONLY ABLE TO TAKE ONE VESSEL WITH ITS CREW THE REST GETTING CLEAR OFF TO SYRACUSE
525-126965-0086 THE ATHENIANS BROUGHT UP TO THEM A SHIP OF TEN THOUSAND TALENTS BURDEN FURNISHED WITH WOODEN TURRETS AND SCREENS AND FASTENED ROPES ROUND THE PILES FROM THEIR BOATS WRENCHED THEM UP AND BROKE THEM OR DIVED DOWN AND SAWED THEM IN TWO
525-126965-0087 MEANWHILE THE SYRACUSANS PLIED THEM WITH MISSILES FROM THE DOCKS
525-126965-0088 SO THAT IT WAS DANGEROUS TO SAIL UP FOR FEAR OF RUNNING THE SHIPS UPON THEM JUST AS UPON A REEF THROUGH NOT SEEING THEM HOWEVER DIVERS WENT DOWN AND SAWED OFF EVEN THESE FOR REWARD ALTHOUGH THE SYRACUSANS DROVE IN OTHERS
525-126965-0089 INDEED THERE WAS NO END TO THE CONTRIVANCES TO WHICH THEY RESORTED AGAINST EACH OTHER AS MIGHT BE EXPECTED BETWEEN TWO HOSTILE ARMIES CONFRONTING EACH OTHER AT SUCH A SHORT DISTANCE AND SKIRMISHES AND ALL KINDS OF OTHER ATTEMPTS WERE OF CONSTANT OCCURRENCE
525-126965-0090 MEANWHILE THE SYRACUSANS SENT EMBASSIES TO THE CITIES COMPOSED OF CORINTHIANS AMBRACIOTS AND LACEDAEMONIANS
525-126965-0091 THAN TO THEIR OWN DISORDER AND GENERALLY
