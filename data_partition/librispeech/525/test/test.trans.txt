525-126965-0092 AS THE ATHENIANS WERE EXPECTED WITH A FRESH ARMY AND IF THE ONE ALREADY THERE COULD BE DESTROYED BEFORE THE OTHER ARRIVED THE WAR WOULD BE AT AN END WHILE THE CONTENDING PARTIES IN SICILY WERE THUS ENGAGED DEMOSTHENES HAVING NOW GOT TOGETHER
525-126965-0093 THE ARMAMENT WITH WHICH HE WAS TO GO TO THE ISLAND
525-126965-0094 A SORT OF ISTHMUS TO WHICH THE HELOTS
525-126965-0095 AND SO TO PROCEED WITHOUT DELAY TO SICILY WHILE CHARICLES WAITED UNTIL HE HAD COMPLETED THE FORTIFICATION OF THE PLACE AND LEAVING A GARRISON THERE RETURNED HOME SUBSEQUENTLY WITH HIS THIRTY SHIPS AND THE ARGIVES ALSO
525-126965-0096 THIS SAME SUMMER ARRIVED AT ATHENS THIRTEEN HUNDRED TARGETEERS THRACIAN SWORDSMEN OF THE TRIBE OF THE DII WHO WERE TO HAVE SAILED TO SICILY WITH DEMOSTHENES SINCE THEY HAD COME TOO LATE THE ATHENIANS DETERMINED TO SEND THEM BACK TO THRACE WHENCE THEY HAD COME
525-126965-0097 TOO EXPENSIVE AS THE PAY OF EACH MAN WAS A DRACHMA A DAY
525-126965-0098 REST OF THE TIME THE ENEMY WAS NOW PERMANENTLY FIXED IN ATTICA AT ONE TIME IT WAS AN ATTACK IN FORCE AT ANOTHER IT WAS THE REGULAR GARRISON
525-126965-0099 WAS IN THE FIELD AND DILIGENTLY PROSECUTING THE WAR GREAT MISCHIEF WAS THEREFORE DONE TO THE ATHENIANS THEY WERE DEPRIVED OF THEIR WHOLE COUNTRY MORE THAN TWENTY THOUSAND SLAVES HAD DESERTED A GREAT PART OF THEM ARTISANS AND ALL THEIR SHEEP AND BEASTS OF BURDEN WERE LOST
525-126965-0100 AND TO GUARD THE COUNTRY THEIR HORSES WERE EITHER LAMED BY BEING CONSTANTLY WORKED UPON ROCKY GROUND OR WOUNDED BY THE ENEMY
525-126965-0101 THE CAVALRY EXCEPTED AT THE DIFFERENT MILITARY POSTS OR UPON THE WALL BUT WHAT
525-126965-0102 WHICH NO ONE WOULD HAVE BELIEVED POSSIBLE IF HE HAD HEARD OF IT BEFORE IT HAD COME TO PASS FOR COULD ANY ONE HAVE IMAGINED THAT EVEN WHEN BESIEGED BY THE PELOPONNESIANS ENTRENCHED IN ATTICA THEY WOULD STILL INSTEAD OF WITHDRAWING FROM SICILY
525-126965-0103 STAY ON THERE BESIEGING IN LIKE MANNER SYRACUSE A TOWN TAKEN AS A TOWN IN NO WAY INFERIOR TO ATHENS OR WOULD SO THOROUGHLY UPSET THE HELLENIC ESTIMATE OF THEIR STRENGTH AND AUDACITY AS TO GIVE THE SPECTACLE OF A PEOPLE WHICH AT THE BEGINNING OF THE WAR
525-126965-0104 SOME THOUGHT MIGHT HOLD OUT ONE YEAR SOME TWO NONE MORE THAN THREE IF THE PELOPONNESIANS INVADED THEIR COUNTRY NOW SEVENTEEN YEARS AFTER THE FIRST INVASION AFTER HAVING ALREADY SUFFERED FROM ALL THE EVILS OF WAR
525-126965-0105 GOING TO SICILY AND UNDERTAKING A NEW WAR NOTHING INFERIOR TO THAT WHICH THEY ALREADY HAD WITH THE PELOPONNESIANS THESE CAUSES
525-126965-0106 PRODUCED THEIR FINANCIAL EMBARRASSMENT AND IT WAS AT THIS TIME THAT THEY IMPOSED UPON THEIR SUBJECTS INSTEAD OF THE TRIBUTE THE TAX OF A TWENTIETH UPON ALL IMPORTS AND EXPORTS BY SEA WHICH THEY THOUGHT WOULD BRING THEM IN MORE MONEY THEIR EXPENDITURE BEING NOW
525-126965-0107 NOT THE SAME AS AT FIRST BUT HAVING GROWN WITH THE WAR WHILE THEIR REVENUES DECAYED ACCORDINGLY NOT WISHING TO INCUR EXPENSE IN THEIR PRESENT WANT OF MONEY THEY SENT BACK AT ONCE THE THRACIANS WHO CAME TOO LATE FOR DEMOSTHENES
525-126965-0108 TO MAKE USE OF THEM IF POSSIBLE IN THE VOYAGE ALONGSHORE TO INJURE THE ENEMY
525-126965-0109 LED THEM AGAINST MYCALESSUS THE NIGHT HE PASSED UNOBSERVED NEAR THE TEMPLE OF HERMES NOT QUITE TWO MILES FROM MYCALESSUS AND AT DAYBREAK ASSAULTED AND TOOK THE TOWN WHICH IS NOT A LARGE ONE THE INHABITANTS BEING OFF THEIR GUARD AND NOT EXPECTING THAT ANY ONE WOULD EVER COME UP
525-126965-0110 AND UNAPPROACHED BY ANY IN SUDDENNESS AND IN HORROR
525-126965-0111 WHERE THE VESSELS WHICH BROUGHT THEM WERE LYING THE GREATEST SLAUGHTER TOOK PLACE WHILE THEY WERE EMBARKING AS THEY DID NOT KNOW HOW TO SWIM AND THOSE IN THE VESSELS ON SEEING
525-126965-0112 A GOOD NUMBER WHO WERE AFTER PLUNDER WERE ACTUALLY CAUGHT IN THE TOWN AND PUT TO DEATH ALTOGETHER THE THRACIANS HAD TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY KILLED OUT OF THIRTEEN HUNDRED
525-126965-0113 BOEOTARCHS THE MYCALESSIANS LOST A LARGE PROPORTION OF THEIR POPULATION WHILE MYCALESSUS THUS EXPERIENCED A CALAMITY FOR ITS EXTENT AS LAMENTABLE AS ANY THAT HAPPENED IN THE WAR
525-126965-0114 AFTER THIS ARRIVING AT ZACYNTHUS AND CEPHALLENIA HE TOOK A BODY OF HEAVY INFANTRY ON BOARD AND SENDING FOR SOME OF THE MESSENIANS
525-126965-0115 TO ALYZIA AND TO ANACTORIUM
525-126965-0116 DURING THE WINTER WITH THE MONEY FOR THE ARMY
525-126965-0117 HERE ALSO CONON CAME TO THEM THE COMMANDER AT NAUPACTUS WITH NEWS THAT THE TWENTY FIVE CORINTHIAN SHIPS STATIONED OPPOSITE TO HIM FAR FROM GIVING OVER THE WAR WERE MEDITATING AN ENGAGEMENT
525-126965-0118 DEMOSTHENES AND EURYMEDON ACCORDINGLY SENT TEN OF THEIR BEST SAILERS WITH CONON
525-126965-0119 AND MEANWHILE PREPARED FOR THE MUSTER OF THEIR FORCES
525-126965-0120 WHO ESCAPED WERE CONDUCTED TO SYRACUSE ABOUT THE SAME TIME THE CAMARINAEANS ALSO CAME TO THE ASSISTANCE OF SYRACUSE WITH FIVE HUNDRED HEAVY INFANTRY THREE HUNDRED DARTERS AND AS MANY ARCHERS WHILE THE GELOANS SENT CREWS FOR FIVE SHIPS FOUR HUNDRED DARTERS AND TWO HUNDRED HORSE
525-126965-0121 INDEED ALMOST THE WHOLE OF SICILY EXCEPT THE AGRIGENTINES WHO WERE NEUTRAL NOW CEASED MERELY TO WATCH EVENTS AS IT HAD HITHERTO DONE AND ACTIVELY JOINED SYRACUSE AGAINST THE ATHENIANS WHILE THE SYRACUSANS AFTER THE SICEL DISASTER
525-126965-0122 PUT OFF ANY IMMEDIATE ATTACK UPON THE ATHENIANS DEMOSTHENES AND EURYMEDON
525-126965-0123 PROMONTORY AND STARTING FROM THENCE
525-126965-0124 WHERE THEY TOOK ON BOARD A HUNDRED AND FIFTY
525-126965-0125 WHO HAD FURNISHED THEM WITH THE DARTERS ARRIVED AT METAPONTIUM IN ITALY HERE THEY PERSUADED THEIR ALLIES THE METAPONTINES TO SEND WITH THEM THREE HUNDRED DARTERS AND TWO GALLEYS AND WITH THIS REINFORCEMENT COASTED ON TO THURII
525-126965-0126 WHERE THEY FOUND THE PARTY HOSTILE TO ATHENS RECENTLY EXPELLED
525-126965-0127 AND ACCORDINGLY REMAINED THERE TO MUSTER AND REVIEW THE WHOLE ARMY TO SEE IF ANY HAD BEEN LEFT BEHIND AND TO PREVAIL UPON THE THURIANS RESOLUTELY TO JOIN THEM IN THEIR EXPEDITION
525-126965-0128 TO SICILY HAD GOT READY FOR ENGAGING AND MANNING SOME ADDITIONAL VESSELS SO AS TO BE NUMERICALLY LITTLE INFERIOR
525-126965-0129 THE PLACE OFF WHICH THEY LAY BEING IN THE FORM OF A CRESCENT THE LAND FORCES FURNISHED BY THE CORINTHIANS AND THEIR ALLIES ON THE SPOT CAME UP AND RANGED THEMSELVES UPON THE PROJECTING HEADLANDS ON EITHER SIDE WHILE THE FLEET
525-126965-0130 A CORINTHIAN HELD THE INTERVENING SPACE AND BLOCKED UP THE ENTRANCE THE ATHENIANS UNDER DIPHILUS NOW SAILED OUT AGAINST THEM WITH THIRTY THREE SHIPS FROM NAUPACTUS AND THE CORINTHIANS
525-126965-0131 WHOSE CHEEKS HAD BEEN STRENGTHENED FOR THIS VERY PURPOSE AFTER AN ACTION OF THIS EVEN CHARACTER IN WHICH EITHER PARTY COULD CLAIM THE VICTORY
525-126965-0132 THE CORINTHIANS NOT PUTTING OUT AGAIN TO MEET THEM THE TWO COMBATANTS PARTED NO PURSUIT TOOK PLACE AND NO PRISONERS WERE MADE ON EITHER SIDE
525-126965-0133 THE ATHENIANS NOW SAILED BACK TO NAUPACTUS AND THE CORINTHIANS IMMEDIATELY SET UP A TROPHY AS VICTORS BECAUSE THEY HAD DISABLED A GREATER NUMBER OF THE ENEMY'S SHIPS
525-126965-0134 ABOUT TWO MILES AND A QUARTER FROM ERINEUS THE CORINTHIAN STATION THIS WAS THE TERMINATION
525-126965-0135 IN ADDITION TO OTHER IMPROVEMENTS SUGGESTED BY THE FORMER SEA FIGHT WHICH THEY NOW ADOPTED IN THE EQUIPMENT OF THEIR NAVY THEY CUT DOWN THEIR PROWS TO A SMALLER COMPASS TO MAKE THEM MORE SOLID AND MADE THEIR CHEEKS STOUTER AND FROM THESE LET STAYS INTO THE VESSELS SIDES
525-126965-0136 IN THE SAME WAY AS THE CORINTHIANS HAD ALTERED THEIR PROWS BEFORE ENGAGING THE SQUADRON AT NAUPACTUS THE SYRACUSANS THOUGHT THAT THEY WOULD THUS HAVE AN ADVANTAGE OVER THE ATHENIAN VESSELS WHICH WERE NOT CONSTRUCTED WITH EQUAL STRENGTH BUT WERE SLIGHT IN THE BOWS
525-126965-0137 FROM THEIR BEING MORE USED TO SAIL ROUND AND CHARGE THE ENEMY'S SIDE THAN TO MEET HIM PROW TO PROW
525-126965-0138 WITH A GREAT MANY SHIPS IN NOT MUCH ROOM WAS ALSO A FACT IN THEIR FAVOUR CHARGING PROW TO PROW THEY WOULD STAVE IN THE ENEMY'S BOWS BY
525-126965-0139 AND SECONDLY THE ATHENIANS FOR WANT OF ROOM WOULD BE UNABLE TO USE THEIR FAVOURITE MANOEUVRE OF BREAKING THE LINE OR OF SAILING ROUND AS THE SYRACUSANS WOULD DO THEIR BEST NOT TO LET THEM DO THE ONE AND WANT OF ROOM WOULD PREVENT THEIR DOING THE OTHER
525-126965-0140 THIS CHARGING PROW TO PROW WHICH HAD HITHERTO BEEN THOUGHT WANT OF SKILL IN A HELMSMAN WOULD BE THE SYRACUSANS CHIEF MANOEUVRE AS BEING THAT WHICH THEY SHOULD FIND MOST USEFUL
525-126965-0141 AND THAT ONLY FOR A LITTLE WAY AND IN THE LITTLE SPACE IN FRONT OF THEIR OWN CAMP
525-126965-0142 AND THE ATHENIANS IF HARD PRESSED BY CROWDING TOGETHER IN A SMALL SPACE AND ALL TO THE SAME POINT WOULD RUN FOUL OF ONE ANOTHER
525-126965-0143 THEY NOT HAVING LIKE THE SYRACUSANS THE WHOLE HARBOUR TO RETREAT OVER
525-126965-0144 A LITTLE THE FIRST AND BROUGHT THEM UP TO THE WALL OF THE ATHENIANS
525-126965-0145 THAT IS TO SAY THE HEAVY INFANTRY THAT
525-126965-0146 AND ALLIES SAILING OUT IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS
525-126965-0147 RETIRING FROM THE LINES THE NEXT DAY THE SYRACUSANS REMAINED QUIET AND GAVE NO SIGNS OF WHAT THEY WERE GOING TO DO BUT NICIAS SEEING THAT THE BATTLE HAD BEEN A DRAWN ONE AND EXPECTING THAT THEY WOULD ATTACK AGAIN COMPELLED THE CAPTAINS TO REFIT ANY OF THE SHIPS THAT HAD SUFFERED
525-126965-0148 FROM EACH OTHER IN ORDER THAT ANY SHIP THAT WAS HARD PRESSED MIGHT BE ABLE TO RETREAT IN SAFETY AND SAIL OUT AGAIN AT LEISURE THESE PREPARATIONS OCCUPIED THE ATHENIANS ALL DAY UNTIL NIGHTFALL
525-126965-0149 TO SEND TO THE OFFICIALS IN THE CITY AND TELL THEM TO MOVE THE SALE MARKET AS QUICKLY AS THEY COULD DOWN TO THE SEA
525-126965-0150 AND SHORTLY AFTERWARDS THE SELFSAME DAY TO ATTACK THE ATHENIANS AGAIN WHEN THEY WERE NOT EXPECTING IT IN COMPLIANCE WITH THIS ADVICE A MESSENGER WAS SENT AND THE MARKET GOT READY UPON WHICH THE SYRACUSANS SUDDENLY BACKED WATER AND WITHDREW TO THE TOWN
525-126965-0151 SUDDENLY THE SYRACUSANS HAD MANNED THEIR SHIPS AND AGAIN SAILED AGAINST THEM AND THE ATHENIANS IN GREAT CONFUSION AND MOST OF THEM FASTING GOT ON BOARD AND WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY PUT OUT TO MEET THEM FOR SOME TIME BOTH PARTIES REMAINED ON THE DEFENSIVE WITHOUT ENGAGING
525-126965-0152 UNTIL THE ATHENIANS AT LAST RESOLVED NOT TO LET THEMSELVES BE WORN OUT BY WAITING WHERE THEY WERE BUT TO ATTACK WITHOUT DELAY AND GIVING A CHEER WENT INTO ACTION THE SYRACUSANS RECEIVED THEM AND CHARGING PROW TO PROW AS THEY HAD INTENDED
525-126965-0153 AND SAILED AGAINST THEIR SIDES AND DISCHARGED FROM THENCE THEIR DARTS UPON THE SAILORS
