2368-157056-0028 GOD WILL RECOGNIZE IT SAID KENNEDY AN ANXIETY OF ANOTHER SORT NOW BEGAN TO STEAL OVER THE DOCTOR'S MIND HE WOULD HAVE GIVEN MUCH OF THE GOLD BEFORE HIM FOR A LITTLE WATER
2368-157056-0029 AND THIS REFLECTION GAVE HIM GREAT UNEASINESS HE HAD TO FEED HIS CYLINDER CONTINUALLY AND HE EVEN BEGAN TO FIND THAT HE HAD NOT ENOUGH TO QUENCH THE THIRST OF HIS PARTY THEREFORE HE DETERMINED TO LOSE NO OPPORTUNITY OF REPLENISHING HIS SUPPLY
2368-157056-0030 UPON GETTING BACK TO THE CAR HE FOUND IT BURDENED WITH THE QUARTZ BLOCKS THAT JOE'S GREED HAD HEAPED IN IT HE GOT IN HOWEVER WITHOUT SAYING ANY THING KENNEDY TOOK HIS CUSTOMARY PLACE AND JOE FOLLOWED BUT NOT WITHOUT CASTING A COVETOUS GLANCE AT THE TREASURES IN THE RAVINE
2368-157056-0031 DO ME THE KINDNESS TO THROW OUT SOME OF THAT QUARTZ BUT DOCTOR YOU GAVE ME LEAVE I GAVE YOU LEAVE TO REPLACE THE BALLAST THAT WAS ALL BUT
2368-157056-0032 WELL JOE THEN YOUR CYLINDER DON'T WORK SAID THE OBSTINATE FELLOW MY CYLINDER IT IS LIT AS YOU PERCEIVE BUT THE BALLOON WILL NOT RISE UNTIL YOU HAVE THROWN OFF A LITTLE BALLAST JOE SCRATCHED HIS EAR PICKED UP A PIECE OF QUARTZ THE SMALLEST IN THE LOT
2368-157056-0033 IT WAS A FRAGMENT OF ABOUT THREE OR FOUR POUNDS AT LAST HE THREW IT OUT BUT THE BALLOON DID NOT BUDGE HUMPH SAID HE WE'RE NOT GOING UP YET NOT YET SAID THE DOCTOR KEEP ON THROWING KENNEDY LAUGHED JOE NOW THREW OUT SOME TEN POUNDS BUT THE BALLOON STOOD STILL
2368-157056-0034 JOE GOT VERY PALE POOR FELLOW SAID THE DOCTOR
2368-157056-0035 SINCE IT WAS PUT IN HERE TO MAKE UP FOR US THROW AWAY FOUR HUNDRED POUNDS SAID JOE PITEOUSLY
2368-157056-0036 IT'S GOING UP I'M SURE KEEP ON YET SAID KENNEDY AND JOE PICKING UP ONE MORE BLOCK DESPERATELY TOSSED IT OUT OF THE CAR THE BALLOON ROSE A HUNDRED FEET OR SO AND AIDED BY THE CYLINDER SOON PASSED ABOVE THE SURROUNDING SUMMITS
2368-157056-0037 THERE YOU ARE RICH FOR THE BALANCE OF YOUR DAYS JOE MADE NO ANSWER BUT STRETCHED HIMSELF OUT LUXURIOUSLY ON HIS HEAP OF QUARTZ SEE MY DEAR DICK THE DOCTOR WENT ON JUST SEE THE POWER OF THIS METAL OVER THE CLEVEREST LAD IN THE WORLD WHAT PASSIONS WHAT GREED WHAT CRIMES
2368-157056-0038 THE KNOWLEDGE OF SUCH A MINE AS THAT WOULD CAUSE IT IS SAD TO THINK OF IT
2368-157057-0000 THE MISTAKE IN THE WATER SUPPLY THE NIGHTS OF THE EQUATOR DOCTOR FERGUSON'S ANXIETIES THE SITUATION FLATLY STATED ENERGETIC REPLIES OF KENNEDY AND JOE ONE NIGHT MORE
2368-157057-0001 THE BALLOON HAVING BEEN MADE FAST TO A SOLITARY TREE ALMOST COMPLETELY DRIED UP BY THE ARIDITY OF THE REGION IN WHICH IT STOOD
2368-157057-0002 IN ALL THIS VAST EXTENT OF COUNTRY I HOPE SO
2368-157057-0003 BUT NOT FINDING ANY THING IN THEM HE HAD FALLEN BACK INTO THE ATTITUDE OF A STRONG MINDED LOOKER ON AND TURNED THE AFFAIR OFF WITH A LAUGH JOE CAST A MOURNFUL GLANCE AT HIM BUT THE DOCTOR MADE NO REPLY HE WAS THINKING NOT WITHOUT SECRET TERROR PROBABLY OF THE VAST SOLITUDES OF SAHARA
2368-157057-0004 FOR THERE WHOLE WEEKS SOMETIMES PASS WITHOUT THE CARAVANS MEETING WITH A SINGLE SPRING OF WATER
2368-157057-0005 THESE ANXIETIES AND THE INCIDENTS RECENTLY OCCURRING HAD NOT BEEN WITHOUT THEIR EFFECT UPON THE SPIRITS OF OUR THREE TRAVELLERS
2368-157057-0006 JOE CLEVER LAD AS HE WAS SEEMED NO LONGER THE SAME PERSON SINCE HIS GAZE HAD PLUNGED INTO THAT OCEAN OF GOLD HE KEPT ENTIRELY SILENT AND GAZED INCESSANTLY UPON THE STONY FRAGMENTS HEAPED UP IN THE CAR WORTHLESS TO DAY BUT OF INESTIMABLE VALUE TO MORROW
2368-157057-0007 NOT EVEN A COLLECTION OF A FEW HUTS AND VEGETATION ALSO WAS DISAPPEARING
2368-157057-0008 THEN CAME THE FIRST TRACT OF GRAYISH SAND AND FLINT
2368-157057-0009 THESE SYMPTOMS OF A TOTALLY DRY AND BARREN REGION GREATLY DISQUIETED DOCTOR FERGUSON IT SEEMED AS THOUGH NO CARAVAN HAD EVER BRAVED THIS DESERT EXPANSE
2368-157057-0010 BUT NOTHING OF THE KIND WAS TO BE SEEN AND THE AERONAUTS FELT THAT ERE LONG AN IMMENSITY OF SAND WOULD COVER THE WHOLE OF THIS DESOLATE REGION
2368-157057-0011 BUT THERE REMAINED ONLY THREE GALLONS IN ALL THE DOCTOR PUT ASIDE ONE GALLON DESTINED TO QUENCH THE BURNING THIRST THAT A HEAT OF NINETY DEGREES RENDERED INTOLERABLE TWO GALLONS ONLY THEN REMAINED TO SUPPLY THE CYLINDER HENCE THEY COULD PRODUCE NO MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY CUBIC FEET OF GAS
2368-157057-0012 YET THE CYLINDER CONSUMED ABOUT NINE CUBIC FEET PER HOUR
2368-157057-0013 FIFTY FOUR HOURS SAID THE DOCTOR TO HIS COMPANIONS THEREFORE AS I AM DETERMINED NOT TO TRAVEL BY NIGHT
2368-157057-0014 WE HAVE THREE DAYS LEFT YOU SAY YES MY DEAR DICK WELL AS GRIEVING OVER THE MATTER WON'T HELP US IN THREE DAYS THERE WILL BE TIME ENOUGH TO DECIDE UPON WHAT IS TO BE DONE IN THE MEANWHILE LET US REDOUBLE OUR VIGILANCE AT THEIR EVENING MEAL THE WATER WAS STRICTLY MEASURED OUT AND THE BRANDY WAS INCREASED IN QUANTITY
2368-157057-0015 THE LATTER BEING MORE LIKELY TO PRODUCE THAN TO QUENCH THIRST
2368-157057-0016 ITS HEIGHT WAS SCARCELY EIGHT HUNDRED FEET ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE SEA THIS CIRCUMSTANCE GAVE THE DOCTOR SOME HOPE SINCE IT RECALLED TO HIS MIND THE CONJECTURES OF GEOGRAPHERS CONCERNING THE EXISTENCE OF A VAST STRETCH OF WATER IN THE CENTRE OF AFRICA BUT IF SUCH A LAKE REALLY EXISTED THE POINT WAS TO REACH IT
2368-157057-0017 AND NOT A SIGN OF CHANGE WAS VISIBLE IN THE MOTIONLESS SKY
2368-157057-0018 THE DOCTOR MIGHT HAVE ESCAPED THIS INTENSE HEAT BY RISING INTO A HIGHER RANGE BUT IN ORDER TO DO SO HE WOULD HAVE HAD TO CONSUME A LARGE QUANTITY OF WATER A THING THAT HAD NOW BECOME IMPOSSIBLE
2368-157057-0019 THE BREAKFAST CONSISTED OF A LITTLE DRIED MEAT AND PEMMICAN
2368-157057-0020 WE CANNOT GO ANY FASTER SAID THE DOCTOR WE NO LONGER COMMAND WE HAVE TO OBEY AH DOCTOR HERE IS ONE OF THOSE OCCASIONS WHEN A PROPELLER WOULD NOT BE A THING TO BE DESPISED
