2368-157056-0002 IS GROWING WEAKER STILL AND I CAN DO NOTHING TO SAVE HIM SAID THE DOCTOR DESPAIRINGLY
2368-157056-0003 AND TO THINK THAT IN SPITE OF ALL THIS GOOD MAN COULD FIND WORDS ONLY TO PITY THEM TO EXCUSE TO PARDON THEM HEAVEN HAS GIVEN HIM A LOVELY NIGHT JOE HIS LAST ON EARTH PERHAPS
2368-157056-0004 HIS BREATHING BECAME DIFFICULT AND HE ASKED FOR AIR THE CURTAINS WERE DRAWN ENTIRELY BACK AND HE INHALED WITH RAPTURE THE LIGHT BREEZES OF THAT CLEAR BEAUTIFUL NIGHT THE STARS SENT HIM THEIR TREMBLING RAYS AND THE MOON WRAPPED HIM IN THE WHITE WINDING SHEET OF ITS EFFULGENCE

2368-157056-0008 HIS LAST GESTURE WAS A SUPREME BLESSING ON HIS NEW FRIENDS OF ONLY ONE DAY THEN HE FELL BACK INTO THE ARMS OF KENNEDY WHOSE COUNTENANCE WAS BATHED IN HOT TEARS DEAD SAID THE DOCTOR BENDING OVER HIM DEAD AND WITH ONE COMMON ACCORD THE THREE FRIENDS KNELT TOGETHER IN SILENT PRAYER
2368-157056-0009 TO MORROW RESUMED THE DOCTOR WE SHALL BURY HIM IN THE AFRICAN SOIL WHICH HE HAS BESPRINKLED WITH HIS BLOOD DURING THE REST OF THE NIGHT THE BODY WAS WATCHED TURN BY TURN BY THE THREE TRAVELLERS AND NOT A WORD DISTURBED THE SOLEMN SILENCE EACH OF THEM WAS WEEPING
2368-157056-0010 TOWARD NOON THE DOCTOR FOR THE PURPOSE OF BURYING THE BODY DECIDED TO DESCEND INTO A RAVINE IN THE MIDST OF SOME PLUTONIC ROCKS OF PRIMITIVE FORMATION THE SURROUNDING MOUNTAINS WOULD SHELTER HIM AND ENABLE HIM TO BRING HIS CAR TO THE GROUND FOR THERE WAS NO TREE IN SIGHT TO WHICH HE COULD MAKE IT FAST
2368-157056-0011 EXCEPT BY RELEASING A QUANTITY OF GAS PROPORTIONATE TO HIS LOSS OF BALLAST AT THE TIME WHEN HE HAD RESCUED THE MISSIONARY HE THEREFORE OPENED THE VALVE OF THE OUTSIDE BALLOON THE HYDROGEN ESCAPED AND THE VICTORIA QUIETLY DESCENDED INTO THE RAVINE
2368-157056-0012 AS SOON AS THE CAR TOUCHED THE GROUND THE DOCTOR SHUT THE VALVE JOE LEAPED OUT HOLDING ON THE WHILE TO THE RIM OF THE CAR WITH ONE HAND AND WITH THE OTHER GATHERING UP A QUANTITY OF STONES EQUAL TO HIS OWN WEIGHT HE COULD THEN USE BOTH HANDS AND HAD SOON HEAPED INTO THE CAR MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS OF STONES
2368-157056-0013 THE SOIL IN FACT WAS BESTREWN WITH QUARTZ AND PORPHYRITIC ROCKS THIS IS A SINGULAR DISCOVERY SAID THE DOCTOR MENTALLY IN THE MEAN WHILE KENNEDY AND JOE HAD STROLLED AWAY A FEW PACES LOOKING UP A PROPER SPOT FOR THE GRAVE THE HEAT WAS EXTREME IN THIS RAVINE
2368-157056-0014 THE BODY OF THE MARTYRED MISSIONARY WAS THEN SOLEMNLY PLACED IN IT THE EARTH WAS THROWN IN OVER HIS REMAINS
2368-157056-0015 THE DOCTOR HOWEVER REMAINED MOTIONLESS AND LOST IN HIS REFLECTIONS
2368-157056-0016 THAT PRIEST WHO TOOK THE OATH OF PERPETUAL POVERTY NOW REPOSES IN A GOLD MINE A GOLD MINE EXCLAIMED KENNEDY AND JOE IN ONE BREATH YES A GOLD MINE SAID THE DOCTOR QUIETLY
2368-157056-0017 JOE AT ONCE RUSHED LIKE A CRAZY MAN AMONG THE SCATTERED FRAGMENTS AND KENNEDY WAS NOT LONG IN FOLLOWING HIS EXAMPLE KEEP COOL JOE SAID HIS MASTER WHY DOCTOR YOU SPEAK OF THE THING QUITE AT YOUR EASE WHAT A PHILOSOPHER OF YOUR METTLE

2368-157056-0022 THOUSANDS OF CROWNS ECHOED JOE IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THERE IS SO MUCH GOLD IN THEM AND THAT ALL THIS IS THE SAME YES MY FRIEND THIS IS A RESERVOIR IN WHICH NATURE HAS BEEN HEAPING UP HER WEALTH FOR CENTURIES THERE IS ENOUGH HERE TO ENRICH WHOLE NATIONS

2368-157056-0025 WILL BE SO MUCH MADE AND JOE WENT TO WORK HE DID SO TOO WITH ALL HIS MIGHT AND SOON HAD COLLECTED MORE THAN A THOUSAND PIECES OF QUARTZ
2368-157056-0026 LAY IN TWENTY TWO DEGREES TWENTY THREE MINUTES EAST LONGITUDE AND FOUR DEGREES FIFTY FIVE MINUTES NORTH LATITUDE
2368-157056-0027 HE WENT BACK TO HIS CAR HE WOULD HAVE ERECTED A PLAIN RUDE CROSS OVER THE TOMB LEFT SOLITARY THUS IN THE MIDST OF THE AFRICAN DESERTS
2368-157056-0028 GOD WILL RECOGNIZE IT SAID KENNEDY AN ANXIETY OF ANOTHER SORT NOW BEGAN TO STEAL OVER THE DOCTOR'S MIND HE WOULD HAVE GIVEN MUCH OF THE GOLD BEFORE HIM FOR A LITTLE WATER
2368-157056-0029 AND THIS REFLECTION GAVE HIM GREAT UNEASINESS HE HAD TO FEED HIS CYLINDER CONTINUALLY AND HE EVEN BEGAN TO FIND THAT HE HAD NOT ENOUGH TO QUENCH THE THIRST OF HIS PARTY THEREFORE HE DETERMINED TO LOSE NO OPPORTUNITY OF REPLENISHING HIS SUPPLY
2368-157056-0030 UPON GETTING BACK TO THE CAR HE FOUND IT BURDENED WITH THE QUARTZ BLOCKS THAT JOE'S GREED HAD HEAPED IN IT HE GOT IN HOWEVER WITHOUT SAYING ANY THING KENNEDY TOOK HIS CUSTOMARY PLACE AND JOE FOLLOWED BUT NOT WITHOUT CASTING A COVETOUS GLANCE AT THE TREASURES IN THE RAVINE
2368-157056-0031 DO ME THE KINDNESS TO THROW OUT SOME OF THAT QUARTZ BUT DOCTOR YOU GAVE ME LEAVE I GAVE YOU LEAVE TO REPLACE THE BALLAST THAT WAS ALL BUT
2368-157056-0032 WELL JOE THEN YOUR CYLINDER DON'T WORK SAID THE OBSTINATE FELLOW MY CYLINDER IT IS LIT AS YOU PERCEIVE BUT THE BALLOON WILL NOT RISE UNTIL YOU HAVE THROWN OFF A LITTLE BALLAST JOE SCRATCHED HIS EAR PICKED UP A PIECE OF QUARTZ THE SMALLEST IN THE LOT
2368-157056-0033 IT WAS A FRAGMENT OF ABOUT THREE OR FOUR POUNDS AT LAST HE THREW IT OUT BUT THE BALLOON DID NOT BUDGE HUMPH SAID HE WE'RE NOT GOING UP YET NOT YET SAID THE DOCTOR KEEP ON THROWING KENNEDY LAUGHED JOE NOW THREW OUT SOME TEN POUNDS BUT THE BALLOON STOOD STILL
