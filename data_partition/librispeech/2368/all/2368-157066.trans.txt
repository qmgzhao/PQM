2368-157066-0000 DOCTOR FERGUSON'S NEW CALCULATIONS KENNEDY'S HUNT
2368-157066-0001 TANGALIA THE RETURN LARI
2368-157066-0002 IT WAS A SORT OF ISLAND OF SOLID GROUND IN THE MIDST OF AN IMMENSE MARSH
2368-157066-0003 THE TWO FRIENDS HAD NOT YET VENTURED TO SPEAK OF THEIR RECENT COMPANION KENNEDY FIRST IMPARTED HIS CONJECTURES TO THE DOCTOR PERHAPS JOE IS NOT LOST AFTER ALL HE SAID HE WAS A SKILFUL LAD AND HAD FEW EQUALS AS A SWIMMER
2368-157066-0004 HE WOULD FIND NO DIFFICULTY IN SWIMMING ACROSS THE FIRTH OF FORTH AT EDINBURGH WE SHALL SEE HIM AGAIN BUT HOW AND WHERE I KNOW NOT LET US OMIT NOTHING ON OUR PART TO GIVE HIM THE CHANCE OF REJOINING US MAY GOD GRANT IT AS YOU SAY DICK REPLIED THE DOCTOR WITH MUCH EMOTION
2368-157066-0005 AND THE END IS WORTH THE TROUBLE THE DOCTOR AND KENNEDY WENT TO WORK AT ONCE BUT THEY ENCOUNTERED GREAT DIFFICULTY
2368-157066-0006 THEY CERTAINLY WITNESSED OUR MISFORTUNE
2368-157066-0007 OH HE'S JUST THE LAD TO GET SAFELY OUT OF THE SCRAPE I REPEAT I HAVE GREAT CONFIDENCE IN HIS SHREWDNESS AND SKILL I HOPE SO NOW DICK YOU MAY GO AND HUNT IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD BUT DON'T GET FAR AWAY WHATEVER YOU DO
2368-157066-0008 SINCE WE HAD TO SACRIFICE NEARLY ALL THE OLD LOT
2368-157066-0009 HEREUPON KENNEDY TOOK A DOUBLE BARRELLED FOWLING PIECE AND STRODE THROUGH THE LONG GRASS TOWARD A THICKET NOT FAR OFF WHERE THE FREQUENT SOUND OF SHOOTING SOON LET THE DOCTOR KNOW THAT THE SPORTSMAN WAS MAKING A GOOD USE OF HIS TIME
2368-157066-0010 MEANWHILE FERGUSON WAS ENGAGED IN CALCULATING THE RELATIVE WEIGHT OF THE ARTICLES STILL LEFT IN THE CAR AND IN ESTABLISHING THE EQUIPOISE OF THE SECOND BALLOON
2368-157066-0011 A SUPPLY OF TEA AND COFFEE ABOUT A GALLON AND A HALF OF BRANDY AND ONE EMPTY WATER TANK ALL THE DRIED MEAT HAD DISAPPEARED THE DOCTOR WAS AWARE THAT BY THE LOSS OF THE HYDROGEN IN THE FIRST BALLOON THE ASCENSIONAL FORCE AT HIS DISPOSAL WAS NOW REDUCED TO ABOUT NINE HUNDRED POUNDS
2368-157066-0012 THE NEW BALLOON MEASURED SIXTY SEVEN THOUSAND CUBIC FEET AND CONTAINED THIRTY THREE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FEET OF GAS THE DILATING APPARATUS APPEARED TO BE IN GOOD CONDITION AND NEITHER THE BATTERY NOR THE SPIRAL HAD BEEN INJURED
2368-157066-0013 HE COULD THEN TAKE WITH HIM ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY POUNDS OF BALLAST FOR UNFORESEEN EMERGENCIES AND THE BALLOON WOULD BE IN EXACT BALANCE WITH THE SURROUNDING ATMOSPHERE
2368-157066-0014 AND THE LATTER WERE FINISHED WHEN KENNEDY RETURNED
2368-157066-0015 HE WENT TO WORK AT ONCE TO DRAW AND SMOKE THE GAME
2368-157066-0016 WAS HUNG OVER A FIRE OF GREEN WOOD WHEN THEY SEEMED IN GOOD ORDER KENNEDY WHO WAS PERFECTLY AT HOME IN THE BUSINESS PACKED THEM AWAY IN THE CAR ON THE MORROW THE HUNTER WAS TO COMPLETE HIS SUPPLIES EVENING SURPRISED OUR TRAVELLERS IN THE MIDST OF THIS WORK
2368-157066-0017 THEIR SUPPER CONSISTED OF PEMMICAN BISCUIT AND TEA AND FATIGUE AFTER HAVING GIVEN THEM APPETITE BROUGHT THEM SLEEP EACH OF THEM STRAINED EYES AND EARS INTO THE GLOOM DURING HIS WATCH SOMETIMES FANCYING THAT THEY HEARD THE VOICE OF POOR JOE
2368-157066-0018 BUT ALAS THE VOICE THAT THEY SO LONGED TO HEAR WAS FAR AWAY AT THE FIRST STREAK OF DAY THE DOCTOR AROUSED KENNEDY
2368-157066-0019 HE HE KNOWS US TOO WELL FOR THAT SUCH A THOUGHT WOULD NEVER COME INTO HIS MIND BUT HE MUST BE INFORMED AS TO WHERE WE ARE
2368-157066-0020 WE SHALL GET INTO OUR CAR AND BE OFF AGAIN THROUGH THE AIR BUT SHOULD THE WIND BEAR US AWAY
2368-157066-0021 IS FORTUNATE NOW OUR EFFORTS THEN WILL BE LIMITED TO KEEPING OURSELVES ABOVE THAT VAST SHEET OF WATER THROUGHOUT THE DAY JOE CANNOT FAIL TO SEE US AND HIS EYES WILL BE CONSTANTLY ON THE LOOKOUT IN THAT DIRECTION PERHAPS HE WILL EVEN MANAGE TO LET US KNOW THE PLACE OF HIS RETREAT
2368-157066-0022 AND IF A PRISONER RESUMED THE DOCTOR IT NOT BEING THE PRACTICE OF THE NATIVES TO CONFINE THEIR CAPTIVES HE WILL SEE US AND COMPREHEND THE OBJECT OF OUR RESEARCHES BUT AT LAST PUT IN KENNEDY
2368-157066-0023 WE SHALL ENDEAVOR TO REGAIN THE NORTHERN PART OF THE LAKE
2368-157066-0024 THERE WE'LL WAIT WE'LL EXPLORE THE BANKS WE'LL SEARCH THE WATER'S EDGE FOR JOE WILL ASSUREDLY TRY TO REACH THE SHORE
2368-157066-0025 LET US SET OUT THEN SAID THE HUNTER
2368-157066-0026 BETWEEN THE VILLAGE OF LARI AND THE VILLAGE OF INGEMINI BOTH VISITED BY MAJOR DENHAM DURING THIS TIME KENNEDY WAS COMPLETING HIS STOCK OF FRESH MEAT
2368-157066-0027 THE LAMANTINE OR MANATEE AND THE HIPPOPOTAMUS HE HAD NO OPPORTUNITY TO SEE A SINGLE SPECIMEN OF THOSE ANIMALS AT SEVEN IN THE MORNING
2368-157066-0028 THE BALLOON'S ANCHOR WAS DETACHED FROM ITS HOLD THE GAS DILATED AND THE NEW VICTORIA ROSE TWO HUNDRED FEET INTO THE AIR IT SEEMED TO HESITATE AT FIRST AND WENT SPINNING AROUND LIKE A TOP
2368-157066-0029 THE DOCTOR CONTINUED TO KEEP AT A HEIGHT OF FROM TWO HUNDRED TO FIVE HUNDRED FEET
2368-157066-0030 SCRUTINIZING THE THICKETS THE BUSHES THE UNDERBRUSH IN FINE EVERY SPOT WHERE A MASS OF SHADE OR JUTTING ROCK COULD HAVE AFFORDED A RETREAT TO THEIR COMPANION THEY SWOOPED DOWN CLOSE TO THE LONG PIROGUES THAT NAVIGATED THE LAKE
2368-157066-0031 WE CAN SEE NOTHING SAID KENNEDY AFTER TWO HOURS OF SEARCH
2368-157066-0032 WE CANNOT BE FAR AWAY FROM THE SCENE OF OUR ACCIDENT BY ELEVEN O'CLOCK THE BALLOON HAD GONE NINETY MILES
2368-157066-0033 WHICH THE DOCTOR TOOK TO BE FARRAM ON WHICH THE CAPITAL OF THE BIDDIOMAHS IS SITUATED FERGUSON EXPECTED AT EVERY MOMENT TO SEE JOE SPRING UP OUT OF SOME THICKET FLYING FOR HIS LIFE AND CALLING FOR HELP WERE HE FREE THEY COULD PICK HIM UP WITHOUT TROUBLE
2368-157066-0034 NOT A SOUND WAS HEARD THE CASE SEEMED DESPERATE
2368-157066-0035 FOR IN SUCH CASE HE WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE FOUND MEANS TO MAKE HIS PRESENCE THERE KNOWN PERHAPS HE HAD BEEN DRAGGED TO THE MAINLAND THE DOCTOR WAS REASONING THUS TO HIMSELF WHEN HE AGAIN CAME IN SIGHT
2368-157066-0036 CAYMANS SWARM IN THESE WATERS BUT NEITHER ONE NOR THE OTHER HAD THE COURAGE TO DISTINCTLY COMMUNICATE THIS IMPRESSION
2368-157066-0037 CROCODILES ARE FOUND ONLY ON THE SHORES OF THE ISLANDS OR OF THE LAKE AND JOE WILL HAVE SKILL ENOUGH TO AVOID THEM BESIDES THEY ARE NOT VERY DANGEROUS AND THE AFRICANS BATHE WITH IMPUNITY AND QUITE FEARLESS OF THEIR ATTACKS KENNEDY MADE NO REPLY
2368-157066-0038 HE PREFERRED KEEPING QUIET TO DISCUSSING THIS TERRIBLE POSSIBILITY
2368-157066-0039 CONSTRUCTED OF WOVEN REEDS AND STANDING IN THE MIDST OF CLEAN AND NEATLY KEPT ENCLOSURES
2368-157066-0040 THE ANCHOR INSTEAD OF CATCHING THE BRANCHES OF THE TREE
