2368-157054-0004 AND HE NOTICED NOTHING MORE IT WAS NO DOUBT ONE OF THOSE LUMINOUS ILLUSIONS THAT SOMETIMES IMPRESS THE EYE IN THE MIDST OF VERY PROFOUND DARKNESS
2368-157054-0005 SO HE MERELY SAW THAT HIS WEAPONS WERE ALL RIGHT AND THEN WITH HIS NIGHT GLASS AGAIN PLUNGED HIS GAZE INTO SPACE
2368-157054-0006 AND THEN BY THE AID OF A RAY OF MOONLIGHT THAT SHOT LIKE AN ELECTRIC FLASH BETWEEN TWO MASSES OF CLOUD HE DISTINCTLY MADE OUT A GROUP OF HUMAN FIGURES MOVING IN THE SHADOW

2368-157054-0012 SOME OF THE NATIVES HAD REALLY CLIMBED THE BAOBAB AND NOW THEY WERE SEEN RISING ON ALL SIDES WINDING ALONG THE BOUGHS LIKE REPTILES AND ADVANCING SLOWLY BUT SURELY
2368-157054-0013 BY THE HORRIBLE ODORS OF THE RANCID GREASE WITH WHICH THEY BEDAUB THEIR BODIES ERE LONG TWO HEADS APPEARED TO THE GAZE OF KENNEDY AND JOE ON A LEVEL WITH THE VERY BRANCH TO WHICH THEY WERE CLINGING ATTENTION SAID KENNEDY FIRE
2368-157054-0014 THE DOUBLE CONCUSSION RESOUNDED LIKE A THUNDERBOLT AND DIED AWAY INTO CRIES OF RAGE AND PAIN AND IN A MOMENT THE WHOLE HORDE HAD DISAPPEARED BUT IN THE MIDST OF THESE YELLS AND HOWLS A STRANGE UNEXPECTED NAY WHAT SEEMED AN IMPOSSIBLE CRY HAD BEEN HEARD
2368-157054-0015 A HUMAN VOICE HAD DISTINCTLY CALLED ALOUD IN THE FRENCH LANGUAGE HELP HELP KENNEDY AND JOE DUMB WITH AMAZEMENT HAD REGAINED THE CAR IMMEDIATELY DID YOU HEAR THAT THE DOCTOR ASKED THEM
2368-157054-0016 WE MUST NOT LEAVE THIS PLACE WITHOUT DOING ALL IN OUR POWER TO SAVE HIM WHEN HE HEARD THE SOUND OF OUR GUNS HE RECOGNIZED AN UNHOPED FOR ASSISTANCE A PROVIDENTIAL INTERPOSITION WE SHALL NOT DISAPPOINT HIS LAST HOPE ARE SUCH YOUR VIEWS

2368-157054-0022 WHOEVER YOU ARE BE OF GOOD CHEER THREE FRIENDS ARE WATCHING OVER YOU A TERRIFIC HOWL FROM THE SAVAGES RESPONDED TO THESE WORDS NO DOUBT DROWNING THE PRISONER'S REPLY THEY ARE MURDERING HIM THEY ARE MURDERING HIM EXCLAIMED KENNEDY
2368-157054-0023 I MASTER WHY I'D ACT MORE PRUDENTLY MAYBE BY TELLING THE PRISONER TO MAKE HIS ESCAPE IN A CERTAIN DIRECTION THAT WE'D AGREE UPON AND HOW WOULD YOU GET HIM TO KNOW THAT BY MEANS OF THIS ARROW THAT I CAUGHT FLYING THE OTHER DAY I'D TIE A NOTE TO IT
2368-157054-0024 AS FOR YOU MY DEAR DICK WITH DETERMINED DARING AND PROFITING BY THEIR ALARM AT OUR FIRE ARMS YOUR PROJECT MIGHT POSSIBLY SUCCEED
2368-157054-0025 BUT LET US ACT AT ONCE SAID THE HUNTER PERHAPS WE MAY SAID THE DOCTOR THROWING CONSIDERABLE STRESS UPON THE WORDS WHY DOCTOR CAN YOU LIGHT UP SUCH DARKNESS AS THIS WHO KNOWS JOE AH IF YOU CAN DO THAT YOU'RE THE GREATEST LEARNED MAN IN THE WORLD
2368-157054-0026 THE DOCTOR KEPT SILENT FOR A FEW MOMENTS HE WAS THINKING HIS TWO COMPANIONS LOOKED AT HIM WITH MUCH EMOTION FOR THEY WERE GREATLY EXCITED BY THE STRANGENESS OF THE SITUATION FERGUSON AT LAST RESUMED HERE IS MY PLAN WE HAVE TWO HUNDRED POUNDS OF BALLAST LEFT
2368-157054-0027 SINCE THE BAGS WE BROUGHT WITH US ARE STILL UNTOUCHED I'LL SUPPOSE THAT THIS PRISONER WHO IS EVIDENTLY EXHAUSTED BY SUFFERING WEIGHS AS MUCH AS ONE OF US
2368-157054-0028 THIS IS THE IDEA DICK YOU WILL ADMIT THAT IF I CAN GET TO THE PRISONER AND THROW OUT A QUANTITY OF BALLAST
2368-157054-0029 BUT THEN IF I WANT TO GET A RAPID ASCENSION SO AS TO ESCAPE THESE SAVAGES I MUST EMPLOY MEANS MORE ENERGETIC THAN THE CYLINDER WELL THEN IN THROWING OUT THIS OVERPLUS OF BALLAST AT A GIVEN MOMENT I AM CERTAIN TO RISE WITH GREAT RAPIDITY THAT'S PLAIN ENOUGH YES BUT THERE IS ONE DRAWBACK
2368-157054-0030 BUT THIS DARKNESS IT HIDES OUR PREPARATIONS AND WILL BE DISPERSED ONLY WHEN THEY ARE FINISHED TAKE CARE TO HAVE ALL OUR WEAPONS CLOSE AT HAND PERHAPS WE MAY HAVE TO FIRE
2368-157054-0031 BUT PERHAPS WE SHALL NOT HAVE TO RESORT TO ALL THIS NOISY WORK ARE YOU READY WE'RE READY RESPONDED JOE THE SACKS WERE PLACED AS REQUESTED
2368-157054-0032 VERY GOOD SAID THE DOCTOR HAVE AN EYE TO EVERY THING JOE WILL SEE TO THROWING OUT THE BALLAST AND DICK WILL CARRY OFF THE PRISONER BUT LET NOTHING BE DONE UNTIL I GIVE THE WORD
2368-157054-0033 HUNG ALMOST MOTIONLESS IN THE AIR IN THE MEAN TIME THE DOCTOR ASSURED HIMSELF OF THE PRESENCE OF A SUFFICIENT QUANTITY OF GAS IN THE MIXING TANK TO FEED THE CYLINDER IF NECESSARY WITHOUT THERE BEING ANY NEED OF RESORTING FOR SOME TIME TO THE BUNTZEN BATTERY
2368-157054-0034 HE THEN TOOK OUT THE TWO PERFECTLY ISOLATED CONDUCTING WIRES WHICH SERVED FOR THE DECOMPOSITION OF THE WATER AND SEARCHING IN HIS TRAVELLING SACK BROUGHT FORTH TWO PIECES OF CHARCOAL
