2368-157057-0000 THE MISTAKE IN THE WATER SUPPLY THE NIGHTS OF THE EQUATOR DOCTOR FERGUSON'S ANXIETIES THE SITUATION FLATLY STATED ENERGETIC REPLIES OF KENNEDY AND JOE ONE NIGHT MORE
2368-157057-0001 THE BALLOON HAVING BEEN MADE FAST TO A SOLITARY TREE ALMOST COMPLETELY DRIED UP BY THE ARIDITY OF THE REGION IN WHICH IT STOOD
2368-157057-0002 IN ALL THIS VAST EXTENT OF COUNTRY I HOPE SO
2368-157057-0003 BUT NOT FINDING ANY THING IN THEM HE HAD FALLEN BACK INTO THE ATTITUDE OF A STRONG MINDED LOOKER ON AND TURNED THE AFFAIR OFF WITH A LAUGH JOE CAST A MOURNFUL GLANCE AT HIM BUT THE DOCTOR MADE NO REPLY HE WAS THINKING NOT WITHOUT SECRET TERROR PROBABLY OF THE VAST SOLITUDES OF SAHARA
2368-157057-0004 FOR THERE WHOLE WEEKS SOMETIMES PASS WITHOUT THE CARAVANS MEETING WITH A SINGLE SPRING OF WATER
2368-157057-0005 THESE ANXIETIES AND THE INCIDENTS RECENTLY OCCURRING HAD NOT BEEN WITHOUT THEIR EFFECT UPON THE SPIRITS OF OUR THREE TRAVELLERS
2368-157057-0006 JOE CLEVER LAD AS HE WAS SEEMED NO LONGER THE SAME PERSON SINCE HIS GAZE HAD PLUNGED INTO THAT OCEAN OF GOLD HE KEPT ENTIRELY SILENT AND GAZED INCESSANTLY UPON THE STONY FRAGMENTS HEAPED UP IN THE CAR WORTHLESS TO DAY BUT OF INESTIMABLE VALUE TO MORROW
2368-157057-0007 NOT EVEN A COLLECTION OF A FEW HUTS AND VEGETATION ALSO WAS DISAPPEARING
2368-157057-0008 THEN CAME THE FIRST TRACT OF GRAYISH SAND AND FLINT
2368-157057-0009 THESE SYMPTOMS OF A TOTALLY DRY AND BARREN REGION GREATLY DISQUIETED DOCTOR FERGUSON IT SEEMED AS THOUGH NO CARAVAN HAD EVER BRAVED THIS DESERT EXPANSE
2368-157057-0010 BUT NOTHING OF THE KIND WAS TO BE SEEN AND THE AERONAUTS FELT THAT ERE LONG AN IMMENSITY OF SAND WOULD COVER THE WHOLE OF THIS DESOLATE REGION
2368-157057-0011 BUT THERE REMAINED ONLY THREE GALLONS IN ALL THE DOCTOR PUT ASIDE ONE GALLON DESTINED TO QUENCH THE BURNING THIRST THAT A HEAT OF NINETY DEGREES RENDERED INTOLERABLE TWO GALLONS ONLY THEN REMAINED TO SUPPLY THE CYLINDER HENCE THEY COULD PRODUCE NO MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY CUBIC FEET OF GAS
2368-157057-0012 YET THE CYLINDER CONSUMED ABOUT NINE CUBIC FEET PER HOUR
2368-157057-0013 FIFTY FOUR HOURS SAID THE DOCTOR TO HIS COMPANIONS THEREFORE AS I AM DETERMINED NOT TO TRAVEL BY NIGHT
2368-157057-0014 WE HAVE THREE DAYS LEFT YOU SAY YES MY DEAR DICK WELL AS GRIEVING OVER THE MATTER WON'T HELP US IN THREE DAYS THERE WILL BE TIME ENOUGH TO DECIDE UPON WHAT IS TO BE DONE IN THE MEANWHILE LET US REDOUBLE OUR VIGILANCE AT THEIR EVENING MEAL THE WATER WAS STRICTLY MEASURED OUT AND THE BRANDY WAS INCREASED IN QUANTITY
2368-157057-0015 THE LATTER BEING MORE LIKELY TO PRODUCE THAN TO QUENCH THIRST
2368-157057-0016 ITS HEIGHT WAS SCARCELY EIGHT HUNDRED FEET ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE SEA THIS CIRCUMSTANCE GAVE THE DOCTOR SOME HOPE SINCE IT RECALLED TO HIS MIND THE CONJECTURES OF GEOGRAPHERS CONCERNING THE EXISTENCE OF A VAST STRETCH OF WATER IN THE CENTRE OF AFRICA BUT IF SUCH A LAKE REALLY EXISTED THE POINT WAS TO REACH IT
2368-157057-0017 AND NOT A SIGN OF CHANGE WAS VISIBLE IN THE MOTIONLESS SKY
2368-157057-0018 THE DOCTOR MIGHT HAVE ESCAPED THIS INTENSE HEAT BY RISING INTO A HIGHER RANGE BUT IN ORDER TO DO SO HE WOULD HAVE HAD TO CONSUME A LARGE QUANTITY OF WATER A THING THAT HAD NOW BECOME IMPOSSIBLE
2368-157057-0019 THE BREAKFAST CONSISTED OF A LITTLE DRIED MEAT AND PEMMICAN
2368-157057-0020 WE CANNOT GO ANY FASTER SAID THE DOCTOR WE NO LONGER COMMAND WE HAVE TO OBEY AH DOCTOR HERE IS ONE OF THOSE OCCASIONS WHEN A PROPELLER WOULD NOT BE A THING TO BE DESPISED
2368-157057-0021 IF WE HAD WATER THIS HEAT WOULD BE OF SERVICE TO US FOR IT DILATES THE HYDROGEN IN THE BALLOON AND DIMINISHES THE AMOUNT REQUIRED IN THE SPIRAL ALTHOUGH IT IS TRUE THAT IF WE WERE NOT SHORT OF THE USEFUL LIQUID WE SHOULD NOT HAVE TO ECONOMIZE IT AH THAT RASCALLY SAVAGE WHO COST US THE TANK
2368-157057-0022 BUT THE HUNDRED POUNDS OF WATER THAT WE THREW OVERBOARD WOULD BE VERY USEFUL TO US NOW
2368-157057-0023 OR QUITE ENOUGH TO CARRY US OVER THIS DESERT
2368-157057-0024 IN DISTANCE YES BUT IN DURATION NO SHOULD THE WIND LEAVE US AND IT EVEN NOW HAS A TENDENCY TO DIE AWAY ALTOGETHER
2368-157057-0025 THE SOIL HOWEVER RAN LOWER FROM MILE TO MILE THE UNDULATIONS OF THE GOLD BEARING MOUNTAINS THEY HAD LEFT DIED AWAY INTO THE PLAIN LIKE THE LAST THROES OF EXHAUSTED NATURE
2368-157057-0026 ONLY A FEW BELTS OF HALF SCORCHED HERBAGE
2368-157057-0027 CRUSHED IN THEIR FALL HAD SCATTERED IN SHARP EDGED PEBBLES WHICH SOON AGAIN BECAME COARSE SAND AND FINALLY IMPALPABLE DUST HERE AT LAST IS AFRICA SUCH AS YOU PICTURED IT TO YOURSELF JOE WAS I NOT RIGHT IN SAYING WAIT A LITTLE EH
2368-157057-0028 DO YOU SEE HE ADDED LAUGHING I HAD NO CONFIDENCE FOR MY PART IN YOUR FORESTS AND YOUR PRAIRIES
2368-157057-0029 TOWARD EVENING THE DOCTOR CALCULATED THAT THE BALLOON HAD NOT MADE TWENTY MILES DURING THAT WHOLE BURNING DAY AND A HEATED GLOOM CLOSED IN UPON IT AS SOON AS THE SUN HAD DISAPPEARED BEHIND THE HORIZON WHICH WAS TRACED AGAINST THE SKY WITH ALL THE PRECISION OF A STRAIGHT LINE THE NEXT DAY WAS THURSDAY THE FIRST OF MAY
2368-157057-0030 BUT THE DAYS FOLLOWED EACH OTHER WITH DESPERATE MONOTONY
2368-157057-0031 AND NIGHT CONDENSED IN ITS SHADOW THE SCATTERED HEAT WHICH THE ENSUING DAY WOULD AGAIN BEQUEATH TO THE SUCCEEDING NIGHT THE WIND NOW SCARCELY OBSERVABLE WAS RATHER A GASP THAN A BREATH AND THE MORNING COULD ALMOST BE FORESEEN WHEN EVEN THAT GASP WOULD CEASE
2368-157057-0032 OF A DISCIPLINED HEART WITH HIS GLASS HE SCRUTINIZED EVERY QUARTER OF THE HORIZON HE SAW THE LAST RISING GROUND GRADUALLY MELTING TO THE DEAD LEVEL AND THE LAST VEGETATION DISAPPEARING WHILE BEFORE HIM STRETCHED THE IMMENSITY OF THE DESERT THE RESPONSIBILITY RESTING UPON HIM PRESSED SORELY
2368-157057-0033 BUT HE DID NOT ALLOW HIS DISQUIET TO APPEAR THOSE TWO MEN DICK AND JOE
2368-157057-0034 HAD HE DONE WELL IN THAT WAS IT NOT LIKE ATTEMPTING TO TREAD FORBIDDEN PATHS WAS HE NOT IN THIS TRIP TRYING TO PASS THE BORDERS OF THE IMPOSSIBLE HAD NOT THE ALMIGHTY RESERVED FOR LATER AGES THE KNOWLEDGE OF THIS INHOSPITABLE CONTINENT
2368-157057-0035 AND BY AN IRRESISTIBLE ASSOCIATION OF IDEAS THE DOCTOR ALLOWED HIMSELF TO BE CARRIED BEYOND THE BOUNDS OF LOGIC AND OF REASON AFTER HAVING ESTABLISHED IN HIS OWN MIND WHAT HE SHOULD NOT HAVE DONE THE NEXT QUESTION WAS WHAT HE SHOULD DO THEN
2368-157057-0036 WERE THERE NOT CURRENTS HIGHER UP THAT WOULD WAFT HIM TO LESS ARID REGIONS WELL INFORMED WITH REGARD TO THE COUNTRIES OVER WHICH HE HAD PASSED HE WAS UTTERLY IGNORANT OF THOSE TO COME AND THUS HIS CONSCIENCE SPEAKING ALOUD TO HIM HE RESOLVED IN HIS TURN TO SPEAK FRANKLY TO HIS TWO COMPANIONS
2368-157057-0037 HE THEREUPON LAID THE WHOLE STATE OF THE CASE PLAINLY BEFORE THEM
2368-157057-0038 WHAT DID THEY THINK ABOUT IT I HAVE NO OTHER OPINION THAN THAT OF MY EXCELLENT MASTER SAID JOE WHAT HE MAY HAVE TO SUFFER I CAN SUFFER AND THAT BETTER THAN HE CAN PERHAPS WHERE HE GOES THERE I'LL GO AND YOU KENNEDY
2368-157057-0039 BESIDES TO RETURN LOOKS TO ME QUITE AS PERILOUS AS THE OTHER COURSE SO ONWARD THEN YOU MAY COUNT UPON US THANKS MY GALLANT FRIENDS REPLIED THE DOCTOR WITH MUCH REAL FEELING I EXPECTED SUCH DEVOTION AS THIS BUT I NEEDED THESE ENCOURAGING WORDS
2368-157057-0040 AND WITH THIS THE THREE FRIENDS WARMLY GRASPED EACH OTHER BY THE HAND NOW HEAR ME SAID THE DOCTOR ACCORDING TO MY SOLAR OBSERVATIONS
2368-157057-0041 IF NEEDS BE WE CAN DIRECT OUR COURSE TO THAT QUARTER AND IT SEEMS OUT OF THE QUESTION THAT WE SHOULD NOT COME ACROSS SOME OASIS OR SOME WELL WHERE WE COULD REPLENISH OUR STOCK OF WATER BUT WHAT WE WANT NOW IS THE WIND FOR WITHOUT IT WE ARE HELD HERE SUSPENDED IN THE AIR AT A DEAD CALM
2368-157057-0042 WHOSE HORIZONTAL RAYS STRETCHED IN LONG LINES OF FIRE OVER THE FLAT IMMENSITY IT WAS THE DESERT
