2368-157054-0000 KENNEDY AND JOE IN THE TREE TWO SHOTS HELP HELP REPLY IN FRENCH THE MORNING THE MISSIONARY THE PLAN OF RESCUE THE NIGHT CAME ON VERY DARK
2368-157054-0001 AS USUAL HE TOOK THE NINE O'CLOCK WATCH AND AT MIDNIGHT DICK RELIEVED HIM KEEP A SHARP LOOKOUT DICK WAS THE DOCTOR'S GOOD NIGHT INJUNCTION
2368-157054-0002 NO BUT I THOUGHT THAT I HEARD VAGUE SOUNDS BELOW US AND
2368-157054-0003 KENNEDY LEANING HIS ELBOW ON THE EDGE OF THE CAR SO AS TO KEEP AN EYE ON THE CYLINDER WHICH WAS ACTIVELY AT WORK GAZED OUT UPON THE CALM OBSCURITY HE EAGERLY SCANNED THE HORIZON AND AS OFTEN HAPPENS TO MINDS THAT ARE UNEASY OR POSSESSED WITH PRECONCEIVED NOTIONS
2368-157054-0004 AND HE NOTICED NOTHING MORE IT WAS NO DOUBT ONE OF THOSE LUMINOUS ILLUSIONS THAT SOMETIMES IMPRESS THE EYE IN THE MIDST OF VERY PROFOUND DARKNESS
2368-157054-0005 SO HE MERELY SAW THAT HIS WEAPONS WERE ALL RIGHT AND THEN WITH HIS NIGHT GLASS AGAIN PLUNGED HIS GAZE INTO SPACE
2368-157054-0006 AND THEN BY THE AID OF A RAY OF MOONLIGHT THAT SHOT LIKE AN ELECTRIC FLASH BETWEEN TWO MASSES OF CLOUD HE DISTINCTLY MADE OUT A GROUP OF HUMAN FIGURES MOVING IN THE SHADOW
2368-157054-0007 HAS ANY THING HAPPENED YES LET US WAKEN JOE THE INSTANT THAT JOE WAS AROUSED KENNEDY TOLD HIM WHAT HE HAD SEEN THOSE CONFOUNDED MONKEYS AGAIN SAID JOE POSSIBLY BUT WE MUST BE ON OUR GUARD
2368-157054-0008 AND IN THE MEANWHILE ADDED THE DOCTOR I WILL TAKE MY MEASURES SO THAT WE CAN ASCEND RAPIDLY AT A MOMENT'S WARNING AGREED LET US GO DOWN THEN SAID JOE DON'T USE YOUR WEAPONS EXCEPTING AT THE LAST EXTREMITY
2368-157054-0009 FOR SOME MOMENTS THEY LISTENED MINUTELY AND MOTIONLESSLY AMONG THE FOLIAGE AND ERE LONG JOE SEIZED KENEDY'S HAND AS HE HEARD A SORT OF RUBBING SOUND AGAINST THE BARK OF THE TREE DON'T YOU HEAR THAT HE WHISPERED YES AND IT'S COMING NEARER SUPPOSE IT SHOULD BE A SERPENT
2368-157054-0010 YES SOMETHING'S COMING UP TOWARD US CLIMBING
2368-157054-0011 THE TWO FRIENDS COULD EVEN CATCH THE SOUND OF A FEW WORDS UTTERED IN THE LOWEST POSSIBLE TONES JOE GENTLY BROUGHT HIS RIFLE TO HIS SHOULDER AS HE SPOKE WAIT SAID KENNEDY
2368-157054-0012 SOME OF THE NATIVES HAD REALLY CLIMBED THE BAOBAB AND NOW THEY WERE SEEN RISING ON ALL SIDES WINDING ALONG THE BOUGHS LIKE REPTILES AND ADVANCING SLOWLY BUT SURELY
2368-157054-0013 BY THE HORRIBLE ODORS OF THE RANCID GREASE WITH WHICH THEY BEDAUB THEIR BODIES ERE LONG TWO HEADS APPEARED TO THE GAZE OF KENNEDY AND JOE ON A LEVEL WITH THE VERY BRANCH TO WHICH THEY WERE CLINGING ATTENTION SAID KENNEDY FIRE
2368-157054-0014 THE DOUBLE CONCUSSION RESOUNDED LIKE A THUNDERBOLT AND DIED AWAY INTO CRIES OF RAGE AND PAIN AND IN A MOMENT THE WHOLE HORDE HAD DISAPPEARED BUT IN THE MIDST OF THESE YELLS AND HOWLS A STRANGE UNEXPECTED NAY WHAT SEEMED AN IMPOSSIBLE CRY HAD BEEN HEARD
2368-157054-0015 A HUMAN VOICE HAD DISTINCTLY CALLED ALOUD IN THE FRENCH LANGUAGE HELP HELP KENNEDY AND JOE DUMB WITH AMAZEMENT HAD REGAINED THE CAR IMMEDIATELY DID YOU HEAR THAT THE DOCTOR ASKED THEM
2368-157054-0016 WE MUST NOT LEAVE THIS PLACE WITHOUT DOING ALL IN OUR POWER TO SAVE HIM WHEN HE HEARD THE SOUND OF OUR GUNS HE RECOGNIZED AN UNHOPED FOR ASSISTANCE A PROVIDENTIAL INTERPOSITION WE SHALL NOT DISAPPOINT HIS LAST HOPE ARE SUCH YOUR VIEWS
2368-157054-0017 THE POOR CAPTIVE CANNOT BE FAR OFF SAID JOE BECAUSE HELP HELP REPEATED THE VOICE BUT MUCH MORE FEEBLY THIS TIME THE SAVAGE WRETCHES EXCLAIMED JOE TREMBLING WITH INDIGNATION SUPPOSE THEY SHOULD KILL HIM TO NIGHT
2368-157054-0018 DO YOU HEAR DOCTOR RESUMED KENNEDY SEIZING THE DOCTOR'S HAND SUPPOSE THEY SHOULD KILL HIM TO NIGHT
2368-157054-0019 THEY MUST HAVE THE SUNSHINE NOW IF I WERE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE DARKNESS TO SLIP DOWN TO THE POOR FELLOW SAID KENNEDY AND I'LL GO WITH YOU SAID JOE WARMLY PAUSE MY FRIENDS PAUSE
2368-157054-0020 TO THE UNFORTUNATE MAN WHOM YOU WISH TO AID WHY SO ASKED KENNEDY THESE SAVAGES ARE FRIGHTENED AND DISPERSED THEY WILL NOT RETURN DICK I IMPLORE YOU HEED WHAT I SAY I AM ACTING FOR THE COMMON GOOD AND IF BY ANY ACCIDENT YOU SHOULD BE TAKEN BY SURPRISE ALL WOULD BE LOST
2368-157054-0021 BUT THINK OF THAT POOR WRETCH HOPING FOR AID WAITING THERE PRAYING CALLING ALOUD IS NO ONE TO GO TO HIS ASSISTANCE HE MUST THINK THAT HIS SENSES DECEIVED HIM THAT HE HEARD NOTHING WE CAN REASSURE HIM ON THAT SCORE SAID DOCTOR FERGUSON AND STANDING ERECT MAKING A SPEAKING TRUMPET OF HIS HANDS
2368-157054-0022 WHOEVER YOU ARE BE OF GOOD CHEER THREE FRIENDS ARE WATCHING OVER YOU A TERRIFIC HOWL FROM THE SAVAGES RESPONDED TO THESE WORDS NO DOUBT DROWNING THE PRISONER'S REPLY THEY ARE MURDERING HIM THEY ARE MURDERING HIM EXCLAIMED KENNEDY
2368-157054-0023 I MASTER WHY I'D ACT MORE PRUDENTLY MAYBE BY TELLING THE PRISONER TO MAKE HIS ESCAPE IN A CERTAIN DIRECTION THAT WE'D AGREE UPON AND HOW WOULD YOU GET HIM TO KNOW THAT BY MEANS OF THIS ARROW THAT I CAUGHT FLYING THE OTHER DAY I'D TIE A NOTE TO IT
2368-157054-0024 AS FOR YOU MY DEAR DICK WITH DETERMINED DARING AND PROFITING BY THEIR ALARM AT OUR FIRE ARMS YOUR PROJECT MIGHT POSSIBLY SUCCEED
2368-157054-0025 BUT LET US ACT AT ONCE SAID THE HUNTER PERHAPS WE MAY SAID THE DOCTOR THROWING CONSIDERABLE STRESS UPON THE WORDS WHY DOCTOR CAN YOU LIGHT UP SUCH DARKNESS AS THIS WHO KNOWS JOE AH IF YOU CAN DO THAT YOU'RE THE GREATEST LEARNED MAN IN THE WORLD
2368-157054-0026 THE DOCTOR KEPT SILENT FOR A FEW MOMENTS HE WAS THINKING HIS TWO COMPANIONS LOOKED AT HIM WITH MUCH EMOTION FOR THEY WERE GREATLY EXCITED BY THE STRANGENESS OF THE SITUATION FERGUSON AT LAST RESUMED HERE IS MY PLAN WE HAVE TWO HUNDRED POUNDS OF BALLAST LEFT
2368-157054-0027 SINCE THE BAGS WE BROUGHT WITH US ARE STILL UNTOUCHED I'LL SUPPOSE THAT THIS PRISONER WHO IS EVIDENTLY EXHAUSTED BY SUFFERING WEIGHS AS MUCH AS ONE OF US
2368-157054-0028 THIS IS THE IDEA DICK YOU WILL ADMIT THAT IF I CAN GET TO THE PRISONER AND THROW OUT A QUANTITY OF BALLAST
2368-157054-0029 BUT THEN IF I WANT TO GET A RAPID ASCENSION SO AS TO ESCAPE THESE SAVAGES I MUST EMPLOY MEANS MORE ENERGETIC THAN THE CYLINDER WELL THEN IN THROWING OUT THIS OVERPLUS OF BALLAST AT A GIVEN MOMENT I AM CERTAIN TO RISE WITH GREAT RAPIDITY THAT'S PLAIN ENOUGH YES BUT THERE IS ONE DRAWBACK
2368-157054-0030 BUT THIS DARKNESS IT HIDES OUR PREPARATIONS AND WILL BE DISPERSED ONLY WHEN THEY ARE FINISHED TAKE CARE TO HAVE ALL OUR WEAPONS CLOSE AT HAND PERHAPS WE MAY HAVE TO FIRE
2368-157054-0031 BUT PERHAPS WE SHALL NOT HAVE TO RESORT TO ALL THIS NOISY WORK ARE YOU READY WE'RE READY RESPONDED JOE THE SACKS WERE PLACED AS REQUESTED
2368-157054-0032 VERY GOOD SAID THE DOCTOR HAVE AN EYE TO EVERY THING JOE WILL SEE TO THROWING OUT THE BALLAST AND DICK WILL CARRY OFF THE PRISONER BUT LET NOTHING BE DONE UNTIL I GIVE THE WORD
2368-157054-0033 HUNG ALMOST MOTIONLESS IN THE AIR IN THE MEAN TIME THE DOCTOR ASSURED HIMSELF OF THE PRESENCE OF A SUFFICIENT QUANTITY OF GAS IN THE MIXING TANK TO FEED THE CYLINDER IF NECESSARY WITHOUT THERE BEING ANY NEED OF RESORTING FOR SOME TIME TO THE BUNTZEN BATTERY
2368-157054-0034 HE THEN TOOK OUT THE TWO PERFECTLY ISOLATED CONDUCTING WIRES WHICH SERVED FOR THE DECOMPOSITION OF THE WATER AND SEARCHING IN HIS TRAVELLING SACK BROUGHT FORTH TWO PIECES OF CHARCOAL
2368-157056-0000 THE DEATH OF A GOOD MAN THE NIGHT OF WATCHING BY THE BODY BARRENNESS AND DROUGHT THE BURIAL THE QUARTZ ROCKS JOE'S HALLUCINATIONS A PRECIOUS BALLAST A SURVEY OF THE GOLD BEARING MOUNTAINS THE BEGINNING OF JOE'S DESPAIR
2368-157056-0001 A MAGNIFICENT NIGHT OVERSPREAD THE EARTH AND THE MISSIONARY LAY QUIETLY ASLEEP IN UTTER EXHAUSTION HE'LL NOT GET OVER IT SIGHED JOE POOR YOUNG FELLOW SCARCELY THIRTY YEARS OF AGE HE'LL DIE IN OUR ARMS HIS BREATHING WHICH WAS SO FEEBLE BEFORE
2368-157056-0002 IS GROWING WEAKER STILL AND I CAN DO NOTHING TO SAVE HIM SAID THE DOCTOR DESPAIRINGLY
2368-157056-0003 AND TO THINK THAT IN SPITE OF ALL THIS GOOD MAN COULD FIND WORDS ONLY TO PITY THEM TO EXCUSE TO PARDON THEM HEAVEN HAS GIVEN HIM A LOVELY NIGHT JOE HIS LAST ON EARTH PERHAPS
2368-157056-0004 HIS BREATHING BECAME DIFFICULT AND HE ASKED FOR AIR THE CURTAINS WERE DRAWN ENTIRELY BACK AND HE INHALED WITH RAPTURE THE LIGHT BREEZES OF THAT CLEAR BEAUTIFUL NIGHT THE STARS SENT HIM THEIR TREMBLING RAYS AND THE MOON WRAPPED HIM IN THE WHITE WINDING SHEET OF ITS EFFULGENCE
2368-157056-0005 MY FRIENDS SAID HE IN AN ENFEEBLED VOICE I AM GOING MAY GOD REQUITE YOU AND BRING YOU TO YOUR SAFE HARBOR
2368-157056-0006 IS BUT THE END OF EARTHLY CARES PLACE ME UPON MY KNEES MY BRETHREN I BESEECH YOU KENNEDY LIFTED HIM UP AND IT WAS DISTRESSING TO SEE HIS WEAKENED LIMBS BEND UNDER HIM MY GOD MY GOD EXCLAIMED THE DYING APOSTLE HAVE PITY ON ME HIS COUNTENANCE SHONE
2368-157056-0007 FAR ABOVE THAT EARTH ON WHICH HE HAD KNOWN NO JOYS IN THE MIDST OF THAT NIGHT WHICH SENT TO HIM ITS SOFTEST RADIANCE ON THE WAY TO THAT HEAVEN TOWARD WHICH HE UPLIFTED HIS SPIRIT AS THOUGH IN A MIRACULOUS ASSUMPTION HE SEEMED ALREADY TO LIVE AND BREATHE IN THE NEW EXISTENCE
2368-157056-0008 HIS LAST GESTURE WAS A SUPREME BLESSING ON HIS NEW FRIENDS OF ONLY ONE DAY THEN HE FELL BACK INTO THE ARMS OF KENNEDY WHOSE COUNTENANCE WAS BATHED IN HOT TEARS DEAD SAID THE DOCTOR BENDING OVER HIM DEAD AND WITH ONE COMMON ACCORD THE THREE FRIENDS KNELT TOGETHER IN SILENT PRAYER
2368-157056-0009 TO MORROW RESUMED THE DOCTOR WE SHALL BURY HIM IN THE AFRICAN SOIL WHICH HE HAS BESPRINKLED WITH HIS BLOOD DURING THE REST OF THE NIGHT THE BODY WAS WATCHED TURN BY TURN BY THE THREE TRAVELLERS AND NOT A WORD DISTURBED THE SOLEMN SILENCE EACH OF THEM WAS WEEPING
2368-157056-0010 TOWARD NOON THE DOCTOR FOR THE PURPOSE OF BURYING THE BODY DECIDED TO DESCEND INTO A RAVINE IN THE MIDST OF SOME PLUTONIC ROCKS OF PRIMITIVE FORMATION THE SURROUNDING MOUNTAINS WOULD SHELTER HIM AND ENABLE HIM TO BRING HIS CAR TO THE GROUND FOR THERE WAS NO TREE IN SIGHT TO WHICH HE COULD MAKE IT FAST
2368-157056-0011 EXCEPT BY RELEASING A QUANTITY OF GAS PROPORTIONATE TO HIS LOSS OF BALLAST AT THE TIME WHEN HE HAD RESCUED THE MISSIONARY HE THEREFORE OPENED THE VALVE OF THE OUTSIDE BALLOON THE HYDROGEN ESCAPED AND THE VICTORIA QUIETLY DESCENDED INTO THE RAVINE
2368-157056-0012 AS SOON AS THE CAR TOUCHED THE GROUND THE DOCTOR SHUT THE VALVE JOE LEAPED OUT HOLDING ON THE WHILE TO THE RIM OF THE CAR WITH ONE HAND AND WITH THE OTHER GATHERING UP A QUANTITY OF STONES EQUAL TO HIS OWN WEIGHT HE COULD THEN USE BOTH HANDS AND HAD SOON HEAPED INTO THE CAR MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS OF STONES
2368-157056-0013 THE SOIL IN FACT WAS BESTREWN WITH QUARTZ AND PORPHYRITIC ROCKS THIS IS A SINGULAR DISCOVERY SAID THE DOCTOR MENTALLY IN THE MEAN WHILE KENNEDY AND JOE HAD STROLLED AWAY A FEW PACES LOOKING UP A PROPER SPOT FOR THE GRAVE THE HEAT WAS EXTREME IN THIS RAVINE
2368-157056-0014 THE BODY OF THE MARTYRED MISSIONARY WAS THEN SOLEMNLY PLACED IN IT THE EARTH WAS THROWN IN OVER HIS REMAINS
2368-157056-0015 THE DOCTOR HOWEVER REMAINED MOTIONLESS AND LOST IN HIS REFLECTIONS
2368-157056-0016 THAT PRIEST WHO TOOK THE OATH OF PERPETUAL POVERTY NOW REPOSES IN A GOLD MINE A GOLD MINE EXCLAIMED KENNEDY AND JOE IN ONE BREATH YES A GOLD MINE SAID THE DOCTOR QUIETLY
2368-157056-0017 JOE AT ONCE RUSHED LIKE A CRAZY MAN AMONG THE SCATTERED FRAGMENTS AND KENNEDY WAS NOT LONG IN FOLLOWING HIS EXAMPLE KEEP COOL JOE SAID HIS MASTER WHY DOCTOR YOU SPEAK OF THE THING QUITE AT YOUR EASE WHAT A PHILOSOPHER OF YOUR METTLE
2368-157056-0018 AH MASTER NO PHILOSOPHY HOLDS GOOD IN THIS CASE COME COME LET US REFLECT A LITTLE WHAT GOOD WOULD ALL THIS WEALTH DO YOU WE CANNOT CARRY ANY OF IT AWAY WITH US WE CAN'T TAKE ANY OF IT WITH US INDEED IT'S RATHER TOO HEAVY FOR OUR CAR I EVEN HESITATED TO TELL YOU ANY THING ABOUT IT
2368-157056-0019 WHAT SAID JOE AGAIN ABANDON THESE TREASURES A FORTUNE FOR US REALLY FOR US OUR OWN LEAVE IT BEHIND TAKE CARE MY FRIEND WOULD YOU YIELD TO THE THIRST FOR GOLD
2368-157056-0020 ALL THAT IS TRUE REPLIED JOE BUT GOLD MISTER KENNEDY WON'T YOU HELP TO GATHER UP A TRIFLE OF ALL THESE MILLIONS WHAT COULD WE DO WITH THEM JOE SAID THE HUNTER UNABLE TO REPRESS A SMILE
2368-157056-0021 THE MILLIONS ARE RATHER HEAVY YOU KNOW RESUMED THE DOCTOR AND CANNOT VERY EASILY BE PUT INTO ONE'S POCKET BUT AT LEAST SAID JOE DRIVEN TO HIS LAST DEFENCES COULDN'T WE TAKE SOME OF THAT ORE FOR BALLAST INSTEAD OF SAND VERY GOOD I CONSENT SAID THE DOCTOR
2368-157056-0022 THOUSANDS OF CROWNS ECHOED JOE IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THERE IS SO MUCH GOLD IN THEM AND THAT ALL THIS IS THE SAME YES MY FRIEND THIS IS A RESERVOIR IN WHICH NATURE HAS BEEN HEAPING UP HER WEALTH FOR CENTURIES THERE IS ENOUGH HERE TO ENRICH WHOLE NATIONS
2368-157056-0023 AN AUSTRALIA AND A CALIFORNIA BOTH TOGETHER IN THE MIDST OF THE WILDERNESS AND THE WHOLE OF IT IS TO REMAIN USELESS PERHAPS BUT AT ALL EVENTS HERE'S WHAT I'LL DO TO CONSOLE YOU
2368-157056-0024 AH MASTER I GIVE UP I SEE THAT YOU ARE RIGHT AND THAT THERE IS NOTHING ELSE TO BE DONE
2368-157056-0025 WILL BE SO MUCH MADE AND JOE WENT TO WORK HE DID SO TOO WITH ALL HIS MIGHT AND SOON HAD COLLECTED MORE THAN A THOUSAND PIECES OF QUARTZ
2368-157056-0026 LAY IN TWENTY TWO DEGREES TWENTY THREE MINUTES EAST LONGITUDE AND FOUR DEGREES FIFTY FIVE MINUTES NORTH LATITUDE
2368-157056-0027 HE WENT BACK TO HIS CAR HE WOULD HAVE ERECTED A PLAIN RUDE CROSS OVER THE TOMB LEFT SOLITARY THUS IN THE MIDST OF THE AFRICAN DESERTS
2368-157056-0028 GOD WILL RECOGNIZE IT SAID KENNEDY AN ANXIETY OF ANOTHER SORT NOW BEGAN TO STEAL OVER THE DOCTOR'S MIND HE WOULD HAVE GIVEN MUCH OF THE GOLD BEFORE HIM FOR A LITTLE WATER
2368-157056-0029 AND THIS REFLECTION GAVE HIM GREAT UNEASINESS HE HAD TO FEED HIS CYLINDER CONTINUALLY AND HE EVEN BEGAN TO FIND THAT HE HAD NOT ENOUGH TO QUENCH THE THIRST OF HIS PARTY THEREFORE HE DETERMINED TO LOSE NO OPPORTUNITY OF REPLENISHING HIS SUPPLY
2368-157056-0030 UPON GETTING BACK TO THE CAR HE FOUND IT BURDENED WITH THE QUARTZ BLOCKS THAT JOE'S GREED HAD HEAPED IN IT HE GOT IN HOWEVER WITHOUT SAYING ANY THING KENNEDY TOOK HIS CUSTOMARY PLACE AND JOE FOLLOWED BUT NOT WITHOUT CASTING A COVETOUS GLANCE AT THE TREASURES IN THE RAVINE
2368-157056-0031 DO ME THE KINDNESS TO THROW OUT SOME OF THAT QUARTZ BUT DOCTOR YOU GAVE ME LEAVE I GAVE YOU LEAVE TO REPLACE THE BALLAST THAT WAS ALL BUT
2368-157056-0032 WELL JOE THEN YOUR CYLINDER DON'T WORK SAID THE OBSTINATE FELLOW MY CYLINDER IT IS LIT AS YOU PERCEIVE BUT THE BALLOON WILL NOT RISE UNTIL YOU HAVE THROWN OFF A LITTLE BALLAST JOE SCRATCHED HIS EAR PICKED UP A PIECE OF QUARTZ THE SMALLEST IN THE LOT
2368-157056-0033 IT WAS A FRAGMENT OF ABOUT THREE OR FOUR POUNDS AT LAST HE THREW IT OUT BUT THE BALLOON DID NOT BUDGE HUMPH SAID HE WE'RE NOT GOING UP YET NOT YET SAID THE DOCTOR KEEP ON THROWING KENNEDY LAUGHED JOE NOW THREW OUT SOME TEN POUNDS BUT THE BALLOON STOOD STILL
2368-157056-0034 JOE GOT VERY PALE POOR FELLOW SAID THE DOCTOR
2368-157056-0035 SINCE IT WAS PUT IN HERE TO MAKE UP FOR US THROW AWAY FOUR HUNDRED POUNDS SAID JOE PITEOUSLY
2368-157056-0036 IT'S GOING UP I'M SURE KEEP ON YET SAID KENNEDY AND JOE PICKING UP ONE MORE BLOCK DESPERATELY TOSSED IT OUT OF THE CAR THE BALLOON ROSE A HUNDRED FEET OR SO AND AIDED BY THE CYLINDER SOON PASSED ABOVE THE SURROUNDING SUMMITS
2368-157056-0037 THERE YOU ARE RICH FOR THE BALANCE OF YOUR DAYS JOE MADE NO ANSWER BUT STRETCHED HIMSELF OUT LUXURIOUSLY ON HIS HEAP OF QUARTZ SEE MY DEAR DICK THE DOCTOR WENT ON JUST SEE THE POWER OF THIS METAL OVER THE CLEVEREST LAD IN THE WORLD WHAT PASSIONS WHAT GREED WHAT CRIMES
2368-157056-0038 THE KNOWLEDGE OF SUCH A MINE AS THAT WOULD CAUSE IT IS SAD TO THINK OF IT
2368-157057-0000 THE MISTAKE IN THE WATER SUPPLY THE NIGHTS OF THE EQUATOR DOCTOR FERGUSON'S ANXIETIES THE SITUATION FLATLY STATED ENERGETIC REPLIES OF KENNEDY AND JOE ONE NIGHT MORE
2368-157057-0001 THE BALLOON HAVING BEEN MADE FAST TO A SOLITARY TREE ALMOST COMPLETELY DRIED UP BY THE ARIDITY OF THE REGION IN WHICH IT STOOD
2368-157057-0002 IN ALL THIS VAST EXTENT OF COUNTRY I HOPE SO
2368-157057-0003 BUT NOT FINDING ANY THING IN THEM HE HAD FALLEN BACK INTO THE ATTITUDE OF A STRONG MINDED LOOKER ON AND TURNED THE AFFAIR OFF WITH A LAUGH JOE CAST A MOURNFUL GLANCE AT HIM BUT THE DOCTOR MADE NO REPLY HE WAS THINKING NOT WITHOUT SECRET TERROR PROBABLY OF THE VAST SOLITUDES OF SAHARA
2368-157057-0004 FOR THERE WHOLE WEEKS SOMETIMES PASS WITHOUT THE CARAVANS MEETING WITH A SINGLE SPRING OF WATER
2368-157057-0005 THESE ANXIETIES AND THE INCIDENTS RECENTLY OCCURRING HAD NOT BEEN WITHOUT THEIR EFFECT UPON THE SPIRITS OF OUR THREE TRAVELLERS
2368-157057-0006 JOE CLEVER LAD AS HE WAS SEEMED NO LONGER THE SAME PERSON SINCE HIS GAZE HAD PLUNGED INTO THAT OCEAN OF GOLD HE KEPT ENTIRELY SILENT AND GAZED INCESSANTLY UPON THE STONY FRAGMENTS HEAPED UP IN THE CAR WORTHLESS TO DAY BUT OF INESTIMABLE VALUE TO MORROW
2368-157057-0007 NOT EVEN A COLLECTION OF A FEW HUTS AND VEGETATION ALSO WAS DISAPPEARING
2368-157057-0008 THEN CAME THE FIRST TRACT OF GRAYISH SAND AND FLINT
2368-157057-0009 THESE SYMPTOMS OF A TOTALLY DRY AND BARREN REGION GREATLY DISQUIETED DOCTOR FERGUSON IT SEEMED AS THOUGH NO CARAVAN HAD EVER BRAVED THIS DESERT EXPANSE
2368-157057-0010 BUT NOTHING OF THE KIND WAS TO BE SEEN AND THE AERONAUTS FELT THAT ERE LONG AN IMMENSITY OF SAND WOULD COVER THE WHOLE OF THIS DESOLATE REGION
2368-157057-0011 BUT THERE REMAINED ONLY THREE GALLONS IN ALL THE DOCTOR PUT ASIDE ONE GALLON DESTINED TO QUENCH THE BURNING THIRST THAT A HEAT OF NINETY DEGREES RENDERED INTOLERABLE TWO GALLONS ONLY THEN REMAINED TO SUPPLY THE CYLINDER HENCE THEY COULD PRODUCE NO MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY CUBIC FEET OF GAS
2368-157057-0012 YET THE CYLINDER CONSUMED ABOUT NINE CUBIC FEET PER HOUR
2368-157057-0013 FIFTY FOUR HOURS SAID THE DOCTOR TO HIS COMPANIONS THEREFORE AS I AM DETERMINED NOT TO TRAVEL BY NIGHT
2368-157057-0014 WE HAVE THREE DAYS LEFT YOU SAY YES MY DEAR DICK WELL AS GRIEVING OVER THE MATTER WON'T HELP US IN THREE DAYS THERE WILL BE TIME ENOUGH TO DECIDE UPON WHAT IS TO BE DONE IN THE MEANWHILE LET US REDOUBLE OUR VIGILANCE AT THEIR EVENING MEAL THE WATER WAS STRICTLY MEASURED OUT AND THE BRANDY WAS INCREASED IN QUANTITY
2368-157057-0015 THE LATTER BEING MORE LIKELY TO PRODUCE THAN TO QUENCH THIRST
2368-157057-0016 ITS HEIGHT WAS SCARCELY EIGHT HUNDRED FEET ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE SEA THIS CIRCUMSTANCE GAVE THE DOCTOR SOME HOPE SINCE IT RECALLED TO HIS MIND THE CONJECTURES OF GEOGRAPHERS CONCERNING THE EXISTENCE OF A VAST STRETCH OF WATER IN THE CENTRE OF AFRICA BUT IF SUCH A LAKE REALLY EXISTED THE POINT WAS TO REACH IT
2368-157057-0017 AND NOT A SIGN OF CHANGE WAS VISIBLE IN THE MOTIONLESS SKY
2368-157057-0018 THE DOCTOR MIGHT HAVE ESCAPED THIS INTENSE HEAT BY RISING INTO A HIGHER RANGE BUT IN ORDER TO DO SO HE WOULD HAVE HAD TO CONSUME A LARGE QUANTITY OF WATER A THING THAT HAD NOW BECOME IMPOSSIBLE
2368-157057-0019 THE BREAKFAST CONSISTED OF A LITTLE DRIED MEAT AND PEMMICAN
2368-157057-0020 WE CANNOT GO ANY FASTER SAID THE DOCTOR WE NO LONGER COMMAND WE HAVE TO OBEY AH DOCTOR HERE IS ONE OF THOSE OCCASIONS WHEN A PROPELLER WOULD NOT BE A THING TO BE DESPISED
2368-157057-0021 IF WE HAD WATER THIS HEAT WOULD BE OF SERVICE TO US FOR IT DILATES THE HYDROGEN IN THE BALLOON AND DIMINISHES THE AMOUNT REQUIRED IN THE SPIRAL ALTHOUGH IT IS TRUE THAT IF WE WERE NOT SHORT OF THE USEFUL LIQUID WE SHOULD NOT HAVE TO ECONOMIZE IT AH THAT RASCALLY SAVAGE WHO COST US THE TANK
2368-157057-0022 BUT THE HUNDRED POUNDS OF WATER THAT WE THREW OVERBOARD WOULD BE VERY USEFUL TO US NOW
2368-157057-0023 OR QUITE ENOUGH TO CARRY US OVER THIS DESERT
2368-157057-0024 IN DISTANCE YES BUT IN DURATION NO SHOULD THE WIND LEAVE US AND IT EVEN NOW HAS A TENDENCY TO DIE AWAY ALTOGETHER
2368-157057-0025 THE SOIL HOWEVER RAN LOWER FROM MILE TO MILE THE UNDULATIONS OF THE GOLD BEARING MOUNTAINS THEY HAD LEFT DIED AWAY INTO THE PLAIN LIKE THE LAST THROES OF EXHAUSTED NATURE
2368-157057-0026 ONLY A FEW BELTS OF HALF SCORCHED HERBAGE
2368-157057-0027 CRUSHED IN THEIR FALL HAD SCATTERED IN SHARP EDGED PEBBLES WHICH SOON AGAIN BECAME COARSE SAND AND FINALLY IMPALPABLE DUST HERE AT LAST IS AFRICA SUCH AS YOU PICTURED IT TO YOURSELF JOE WAS I NOT RIGHT IN SAYING WAIT A LITTLE EH
2368-157057-0028 DO YOU SEE HE ADDED LAUGHING I HAD NO CONFIDENCE FOR MY PART IN YOUR FORESTS AND YOUR PRAIRIES
2368-157057-0029 TOWARD EVENING THE DOCTOR CALCULATED THAT THE BALLOON HAD NOT MADE TWENTY MILES DURING THAT WHOLE BURNING DAY AND A HEATED GLOOM CLOSED IN UPON IT AS SOON AS THE SUN HAD DISAPPEARED BEHIND THE HORIZON WHICH WAS TRACED AGAINST THE SKY WITH ALL THE PRECISION OF A STRAIGHT LINE THE NEXT DAY WAS THURSDAY THE FIRST OF MAY
2368-157057-0030 BUT THE DAYS FOLLOWED EACH OTHER WITH DESPERATE MONOTONY
2368-157057-0031 AND NIGHT CONDENSED IN ITS SHADOW THE SCATTERED HEAT WHICH THE ENSUING DAY WOULD AGAIN BEQUEATH TO THE SUCCEEDING NIGHT THE WIND NOW SCARCELY OBSERVABLE WAS RATHER A GASP THAN A BREATH AND THE MORNING COULD ALMOST BE FORESEEN WHEN EVEN THAT GASP WOULD CEASE
2368-157057-0032 OF A DISCIPLINED HEART WITH HIS GLASS HE SCRUTINIZED EVERY QUARTER OF THE HORIZON HE SAW THE LAST RISING GROUND GRADUALLY MELTING TO THE DEAD LEVEL AND THE LAST VEGETATION DISAPPEARING WHILE BEFORE HIM STRETCHED THE IMMENSITY OF THE DESERT THE RESPONSIBILITY RESTING UPON HIM PRESSED SORELY
2368-157057-0033 BUT HE DID NOT ALLOW HIS DISQUIET TO APPEAR THOSE TWO MEN DICK AND JOE
2368-157057-0034 HAD HE DONE WELL IN THAT WAS IT NOT LIKE ATTEMPTING TO TREAD FORBIDDEN PATHS WAS HE NOT IN THIS TRIP TRYING TO PASS THE BORDERS OF THE IMPOSSIBLE HAD NOT THE ALMIGHTY RESERVED FOR LATER AGES THE KNOWLEDGE OF THIS INHOSPITABLE CONTINENT
2368-157057-0035 AND BY AN IRRESISTIBLE ASSOCIATION OF IDEAS THE DOCTOR ALLOWED HIMSELF TO BE CARRIED BEYOND THE BOUNDS OF LOGIC AND OF REASON AFTER HAVING ESTABLISHED IN HIS OWN MIND WHAT HE SHOULD NOT HAVE DONE THE NEXT QUESTION WAS WHAT HE SHOULD DO THEN
2368-157057-0036 WERE THERE NOT CURRENTS HIGHER UP THAT WOULD WAFT HIM TO LESS ARID REGIONS WELL INFORMED WITH REGARD TO THE COUNTRIES OVER WHICH HE HAD PASSED HE WAS UTTERLY IGNORANT OF THOSE TO COME AND THUS HIS CONSCIENCE SPEAKING ALOUD TO HIM HE RESOLVED IN HIS TURN TO SPEAK FRANKLY TO HIS TWO COMPANIONS
2368-157057-0037 HE THEREUPON LAID THE WHOLE STATE OF THE CASE PLAINLY BEFORE THEM
2368-157057-0038 WHAT DID THEY THINK ABOUT IT I HAVE NO OTHER OPINION THAN THAT OF MY EXCELLENT MASTER SAID JOE WHAT HE MAY HAVE TO SUFFER I CAN SUFFER AND THAT BETTER THAN HE CAN PERHAPS WHERE HE GOES THERE I'LL GO AND YOU KENNEDY
2368-157057-0039 BESIDES TO RETURN LOOKS TO ME QUITE AS PERILOUS AS THE OTHER COURSE SO ONWARD THEN YOU MAY COUNT UPON US THANKS MY GALLANT FRIENDS REPLIED THE DOCTOR WITH MUCH REAL FEELING I EXPECTED SUCH DEVOTION AS THIS BUT I NEEDED THESE ENCOURAGING WORDS
2368-157057-0040 AND WITH THIS THE THREE FRIENDS WARMLY GRASPED EACH OTHER BY THE HAND NOW HEAR ME SAID THE DOCTOR ACCORDING TO MY SOLAR OBSERVATIONS
2368-157057-0041 IF NEEDS BE WE CAN DIRECT OUR COURSE TO THAT QUARTER AND IT SEEMS OUT OF THE QUESTION THAT WE SHOULD NOT COME ACROSS SOME OASIS OR SOME WELL WHERE WE COULD REPLENISH OUR STOCK OF WATER BUT WHAT WE WANT NOW IS THE WIND FOR WITHOUT IT WE ARE HELD HERE SUSPENDED IN THE AIR AT A DEAD CALM
2368-157057-0042 WHOSE HORIZONTAL RAYS STRETCHED IN LONG LINES OF FIRE OVER THE FLAT IMMENSITY IT WAS THE DESERT
2368-157066-0000 DOCTOR FERGUSON'S NEW CALCULATIONS KENNEDY'S HUNT
2368-157066-0001 TANGALIA THE RETURN LARI
2368-157066-0002 IT WAS A SORT OF ISLAND OF SOLID GROUND IN THE MIDST OF AN IMMENSE MARSH
2368-157066-0003 THE TWO FRIENDS HAD NOT YET VENTURED TO SPEAK OF THEIR RECENT COMPANION KENNEDY FIRST IMPARTED HIS CONJECTURES TO THE DOCTOR PERHAPS JOE IS NOT LOST AFTER ALL HE SAID HE WAS A SKILFUL LAD AND HAD FEW EQUALS AS A SWIMMER
2368-157066-0004 HE WOULD FIND NO DIFFICULTY IN SWIMMING ACROSS THE FIRTH OF FORTH AT EDINBURGH WE SHALL SEE HIM AGAIN BUT HOW AND WHERE I KNOW NOT LET US OMIT NOTHING ON OUR PART TO GIVE HIM THE CHANCE OF REJOINING US MAY GOD GRANT IT AS YOU SAY DICK REPLIED THE DOCTOR WITH MUCH EMOTION
2368-157066-0005 AND THE END IS WORTH THE TROUBLE THE DOCTOR AND KENNEDY WENT TO WORK AT ONCE BUT THEY ENCOUNTERED GREAT DIFFICULTY
2368-157066-0006 THEY CERTAINLY WITNESSED OUR MISFORTUNE
2368-157066-0007 OH HE'S JUST THE LAD TO GET SAFELY OUT OF THE SCRAPE I REPEAT I HAVE GREAT CONFIDENCE IN HIS SHREWDNESS AND SKILL I HOPE SO NOW DICK YOU MAY GO AND HUNT IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD BUT DON'T GET FAR AWAY WHATEVER YOU DO
2368-157066-0008 SINCE WE HAD TO SACRIFICE NEARLY ALL THE OLD LOT
2368-157066-0009 HEREUPON KENNEDY TOOK A DOUBLE BARRELLED FOWLING PIECE AND STRODE THROUGH THE LONG GRASS TOWARD A THICKET NOT FAR OFF WHERE THE FREQUENT SOUND OF SHOOTING SOON LET THE DOCTOR KNOW THAT THE SPORTSMAN WAS MAKING A GOOD USE OF HIS TIME
2368-157066-0010 MEANWHILE FERGUSON WAS ENGAGED IN CALCULATING THE RELATIVE WEIGHT OF THE ARTICLES STILL LEFT IN THE CAR AND IN ESTABLISHING THE EQUIPOISE OF THE SECOND BALLOON
2368-157066-0011 A SUPPLY OF TEA AND COFFEE ABOUT A GALLON AND A HALF OF BRANDY AND ONE EMPTY WATER TANK ALL THE DRIED MEAT HAD DISAPPEARED THE DOCTOR WAS AWARE THAT BY THE LOSS OF THE HYDROGEN IN THE FIRST BALLOON THE ASCENSIONAL FORCE AT HIS DISPOSAL WAS NOW REDUCED TO ABOUT NINE HUNDRED POUNDS
2368-157066-0012 THE NEW BALLOON MEASURED SIXTY SEVEN THOUSAND CUBIC FEET AND CONTAINED THIRTY THREE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FEET OF GAS THE DILATING APPARATUS APPEARED TO BE IN GOOD CONDITION AND NEITHER THE BATTERY NOR THE SPIRAL HAD BEEN INJURED
2368-157066-0013 HE COULD THEN TAKE WITH HIM ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY POUNDS OF BALLAST FOR UNFORESEEN EMERGENCIES AND THE BALLOON WOULD BE IN EXACT BALANCE WITH THE SURROUNDING ATMOSPHERE
2368-157066-0014 AND THE LATTER WERE FINISHED WHEN KENNEDY RETURNED
2368-157066-0015 HE WENT TO WORK AT ONCE TO DRAW AND SMOKE THE GAME
2368-157066-0016 WAS HUNG OVER A FIRE OF GREEN WOOD WHEN THEY SEEMED IN GOOD ORDER KENNEDY WHO WAS PERFECTLY AT HOME IN THE BUSINESS PACKED THEM AWAY IN THE CAR ON THE MORROW THE HUNTER WAS TO COMPLETE HIS SUPPLIES EVENING SURPRISED OUR TRAVELLERS IN THE MIDST OF THIS WORK
2368-157066-0017 THEIR SUPPER CONSISTED OF PEMMICAN BISCUIT AND TEA AND FATIGUE AFTER HAVING GIVEN THEM APPETITE BROUGHT THEM SLEEP EACH OF THEM STRAINED EYES AND EARS INTO THE GLOOM DURING HIS WATCH SOMETIMES FANCYING THAT THEY HEARD THE VOICE OF POOR JOE
2368-157066-0018 BUT ALAS THE VOICE THAT THEY SO LONGED TO HEAR WAS FAR AWAY AT THE FIRST STREAK OF DAY THE DOCTOR AROUSED KENNEDY
2368-157066-0019 HE HE KNOWS US TOO WELL FOR THAT SUCH A THOUGHT WOULD NEVER COME INTO HIS MIND BUT HE MUST BE INFORMED AS TO WHERE WE ARE
2368-157066-0020 WE SHALL GET INTO OUR CAR AND BE OFF AGAIN THROUGH THE AIR BUT SHOULD THE WIND BEAR US AWAY
2368-157066-0021 IS FORTUNATE NOW OUR EFFORTS THEN WILL BE LIMITED TO KEEPING OURSELVES ABOVE THAT VAST SHEET OF WATER THROUGHOUT THE DAY JOE CANNOT FAIL TO SEE US AND HIS EYES WILL BE CONSTANTLY ON THE LOOKOUT IN THAT DIRECTION PERHAPS HE WILL EVEN MANAGE TO LET US KNOW THE PLACE OF HIS RETREAT
2368-157066-0022 AND IF A PRISONER RESUMED THE DOCTOR IT NOT BEING THE PRACTICE OF THE NATIVES TO CONFINE THEIR CAPTIVES HE WILL SEE US AND COMPREHEND THE OBJECT OF OUR RESEARCHES BUT AT LAST PUT IN KENNEDY
2368-157066-0023 WE SHALL ENDEAVOR TO REGAIN THE NORTHERN PART OF THE LAKE
2368-157066-0024 THERE WE'LL WAIT WE'LL EXPLORE THE BANKS WE'LL SEARCH THE WATER'S EDGE FOR JOE WILL ASSUREDLY TRY TO REACH THE SHORE
2368-157066-0025 LET US SET OUT THEN SAID THE HUNTER
2368-157066-0026 BETWEEN THE VILLAGE OF LARI AND THE VILLAGE OF INGEMINI BOTH VISITED BY MAJOR DENHAM DURING THIS TIME KENNEDY WAS COMPLETING HIS STOCK OF FRESH MEAT
2368-157066-0027 THE LAMANTINE OR MANATEE AND THE HIPPOPOTAMUS HE HAD NO OPPORTUNITY TO SEE A SINGLE SPECIMEN OF THOSE ANIMALS AT SEVEN IN THE MORNING
2368-157066-0028 THE BALLOON'S ANCHOR WAS DETACHED FROM ITS HOLD THE GAS DILATED AND THE NEW VICTORIA ROSE TWO HUNDRED FEET INTO THE AIR IT SEEMED TO HESITATE AT FIRST AND WENT SPINNING AROUND LIKE A TOP
2368-157066-0029 THE DOCTOR CONTINUED TO KEEP AT A HEIGHT OF FROM TWO HUNDRED TO FIVE HUNDRED FEET
2368-157066-0030 SCRUTINIZING THE THICKETS THE BUSHES THE UNDERBRUSH IN FINE EVERY SPOT WHERE A MASS OF SHADE OR JUTTING ROCK COULD HAVE AFFORDED A RETREAT TO THEIR COMPANION THEY SWOOPED DOWN CLOSE TO THE LONG PIROGUES THAT NAVIGATED THE LAKE
2368-157066-0031 WE CAN SEE NOTHING SAID KENNEDY AFTER TWO HOURS OF SEARCH
2368-157066-0032 WE CANNOT BE FAR AWAY FROM THE SCENE OF OUR ACCIDENT BY ELEVEN O'CLOCK THE BALLOON HAD GONE NINETY MILES
2368-157066-0033 WHICH THE DOCTOR TOOK TO BE FARRAM ON WHICH THE CAPITAL OF THE BIDDIOMAHS IS SITUATED FERGUSON EXPECTED AT EVERY MOMENT TO SEE JOE SPRING UP OUT OF SOME THICKET FLYING FOR HIS LIFE AND CALLING FOR HELP WERE HE FREE THEY COULD PICK HIM UP WITHOUT TROUBLE
2368-157066-0034 NOT A SOUND WAS HEARD THE CASE SEEMED DESPERATE
2368-157066-0035 FOR IN SUCH CASE HE WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE FOUND MEANS TO MAKE HIS PRESENCE THERE KNOWN PERHAPS HE HAD BEEN DRAGGED TO THE MAINLAND THE DOCTOR WAS REASONING THUS TO HIMSELF WHEN HE AGAIN CAME IN SIGHT
2368-157066-0036 CAYMANS SWARM IN THESE WATERS BUT NEITHER ONE NOR THE OTHER HAD THE COURAGE TO DISTINCTLY COMMUNICATE THIS IMPRESSION
2368-157066-0037 CROCODILES ARE FOUND ONLY ON THE SHORES OF THE ISLANDS OR OF THE LAKE AND JOE WILL HAVE SKILL ENOUGH TO AVOID THEM BESIDES THEY ARE NOT VERY DANGEROUS AND THE AFRICANS BATHE WITH IMPUNITY AND QUITE FEARLESS OF THEIR ATTACKS KENNEDY MADE NO REPLY
2368-157066-0038 HE PREFERRED KEEPING QUIET TO DISCUSSING THIS TERRIBLE POSSIBILITY
2368-157066-0039 CONSTRUCTED OF WOVEN REEDS AND STANDING IN THE MIDST OF CLEAN AND NEATLY KEPT ENCLOSURES
2368-157066-0040 THE ANCHOR INSTEAD OF CATCHING THE BRANCHES OF THE TREE
