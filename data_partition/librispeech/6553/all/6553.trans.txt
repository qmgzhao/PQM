6553-82558-0002 BY LITERATURE OR ELEGANCE OR RANK DISTINGUISHED SCARCELY WAS A YEAR THUS SPENT
6553-82558-0003 THE CROWDED SOLITUDE WITH LESS REGRET
6553-82558-0004 THAN FOR THE HUMBLE BOOK STALLS IN THE STREETS EXPOSED TO EYE AND HAND WHERE'ER I TURNED FRANCE LURED ME FORTH
6553-82558-0005 RELINQUISHING THE SCRIP AND STAFF AND ALL ENJOYMENT WHICH THE SUMMER SUN SHEDS ROUND THE STEPS OF THOSE WHO MEET THE DAY WITH MOTION CONSTANT AS HIS OWN I WENT PREPARED
6553-82558-0006 THROUGH PARIS LAY MY READIEST COURSE AND THERE SOJOURNING A FEW DAYS I VISITED IN HASTE EACH SPOT OF OLD OR RECENT FAME THE LATTER CHIEFLY
6553-82558-0007 AND FROM MONT MARTYR SOUTHWARD TO THE DOME OF
6553-82558-0008 I STARED AND LISTENED WITH A STRANGER'S EARS TO HAWKERS AND HARANGUERS HUBBUB WILD AND HISSING FACTIONISTS WITH ARDENT EYES IN KNOTS OR PAIRS OR SINGLE
6553-82558-0009 WHERE SILENT ZEPHYRS SPORTED WITH THE DUST OF THE BASTILLE I SATE IN THE OPEN SUN AND FROM THE RUBBISH GATHERED UP A STONE
6553-82558-0010 RECOMPENSE THE TRAVELLER'S PAINS LESS THAN THE
6553-82558-0011 THERE BY NOVELTIES IN SPEECH DOMESTIC MANNERS CUSTOMS GESTURES LOOKS AND ALL THE ATTIRE OF ORDINARY LIFE ATTENTION WAS ENGROSSED
6553-82558-0012 MID THOSE CONCUSSIONS UNCONCERNED TRANQUIL ALMOST AND CARELESS AS A FLOWER GLASSED IN A GREEN HOUSE OR A PARLOUR SHRUB THAT SPREADS ITS LEAVES IN UNMOLESTED PEACE
6553-82558-0013 INDIFFERENCE THIS WHICH MAY SEEM STRANGE BUT I WAS UNPREPARED WITH NEEDFUL KNOWLEDGE HAD ABRUPTLY PASSED INTO A THEATRE
6553-82558-0014 I HAD SKIMMED AND SOMETIMES READ WITH CARE THE MASTER PAMPHLETS OF THE DAY NOR WANTED SUCH HALF INSIGHT AS GREW WILD UPON THAT MEAGRE SOIL HELPED OUT BY TALK AND PUBLIC NEWS
6553-82558-0015 THAT MIGHT SUFFICE TO SHOW WHENCE THE MAIN ORGANS OF THE PUBLIC POWER HAD SPRUNG THEIR TRANSMIGRATIONS WHEN AND HOW ACCOMPLISHED GIVING THUS UNTO EVENTS A FORM AND BODY
6553-82558-0016 AND THE AFFECTIONS LEFT WITHOUT A VITAL INTEREST AT THAT TIME MOREOVER THE FIRST STORM WAS OVERBLOWN AND THE STRONG HAND OF OUTWARD VIOLENCE LOCKED UP IN QUIET
6553-82558-0017 WITH SO GREAT A THEME TO SPEAK AS I MUST BE COMPELLED TO DO OF ONE SO UNIMPORTANT NIGHT BY NIGHT DID I FREQUENT THE FORMAL HAUNTS OF MEN WHOM IN THE CITY
6553-82558-0018 SOCIETIES POLISHED IN ARTS AND IN PUNCTILIO VERSED WHENCE AND FROM DEEPER CAUSES ALL DISCOURSE OF GOOD AND EVIL
6553-82558-0019 SEASONED IN THE WARS AND ALL WERE MEN WELL BORN THE CHIVALRY OF FRANCE IN AGE AND TEMPER DIFFERING
6553-82558-0020 WAS THE STATE OF THINGS MEANWHILE THE CHIEF OF MY ASSOCIATES STOOD PREPARED FOR FLIGHT
6553-82558-0021 OF NATIONS AND THEIR PASSING INTERESTS IF WITH UNWORLDLY ENDS AND AIMS COMPARED ALMOST INDIFFERENT EVEN THE HISTORIAN'S TALE
6553-82558-0022 AS IT MADE THE HEART BEAT HIGH AND FILLED THE FANCY WITH FAIR FORMS OLD HEROES AND THEIR SUFFERINGS AND THEIR DEEDS YET IN THE REGAL SCEPTRE AND THE POMP OF ORDERS AND DEGREES
6553-82558-0023 THAN ANY OTHER NOOK OF ENGLISH GROUND
6553-82558-0024 TO SANCTION THE PROUD WORKINGS OF THE SOUL AND MOUNTAIN LIBERTY IT COULD NOT BE BUT THAT ONE TUTORED THUS SHOULD LOOK WITH AWE UPON THE FACULTIES OF MAN
6553-82558-0025 AND HAIL AS BEST THE GOVERNMENT OF EQUAL RIGHTS AND
6553-82558-0026 CONFUSION STRICKEN BY A HIGHER POWER THAN HUMAN UNDERSTANDING
6553-82558-0027 DO TEARS START INTO MINE EYES I DO NOT SAY I WEEP I WEPT NOT THEN BUT TEARS HAVE DIMMED MY SIGHT
6553-82558-0028 FEMALE FORTITUDE AT DEAREST SEPARATION PATRIOT LOVE AND SELF DEVOTION AND TERRESTRIAL HOPE
6553-82558-0029 AND THEY SEEMED ARGUMENTS SENT FROM HEAVEN TO PROVE THE CAUSE GOOD PURE
6553-82558-0030 WHEN FOOT HATH CRUSHED THEM HE THROUGH THE EVENTS OF THAT GREAT CHANGE WANDERED IN PERFECT FAITH
6553-82558-0031 LIKE THAT WHICH HE A SOLDIER IN HIS IDLER DAY HAD PAID TO WOMAN
6553-82558-0032 WHILE HE WAS INTENT ON WORKS OF LOVE OR FREEDOM OR REVOLVED COMPLACENTLY THE PROGRESS OF A CAUSE WHEREOF HE WAS A PART YET THIS WAS MEEK AND PLACID
6553-82558-0033 OFT IN SOLITUDE WITH HIM DID I DISCOURSE ABOUT THE END OF CIVIL GOVERNMENT AND ITS WISEST FORMS
6553-82558-0034 BY OBJECTS OVER NEAR NOT PRESSED UPON
6553-82558-0035 CAPABLE OF CLEAR TRUTH THE ONE TO BREAK BONDAGE THE OTHER TO BUILD LIBERTY ON FIRM FOUNDATIONS
6553-82558-0036 IF NATURE THEN BE STANDING ON THE BRINK OF SOME GREAT TRIAL AND WE HEAR THE VOICE OF ONE DEVOTED
6553-82558-0037 HIS DEEP SENSE IN ACTION GIVE IT OUTWARDLY A SHAPE AND THAT OF BENEDICTION TO THE WORLD THEN DOUBT IS NOT AND TRUTH IS MORE THAN TRUTH A HOPE IT IS AND A DESIRE
6553-82558-0038 BY AN AUTHORITY DIVINE SANCTIONED OF DANGER DIFFICULTY OR DEATH SUCH CONVERSATION UNDER ATTIC SHADES DID DION HOLD WITH PLATO O RIPENED THUS FOR A DELIVERER'S GLORIOUS TASK
6553-82558-0039 WHEN THOSE TWO VESSELS WITH THEIR DARING FREIGHT
6553-82558-0040 ACCOUTRED FOR THE WORST HE PERISHED FIGHTING IN SUPREME COMMAND UPON THE BORDERS OF THE UNHAPPY LOIRE
6553-82558-0041 OFT AMID THOSE HAUNTS FROM EARNEST DIALOGUES I SLIPPED IN THOUGHT AND LET REMEMBRANCE STEAL TO OTHER TIMES
6553-82558-0042 OR A WAVELESS SEA SOME HERMIT FROM HIS CELL FORTH STRAYED MIGHT PACE IN SYLVAN MEDITATION UNDISTURBED AS ON THE PAVEMENT OF A GOTHIC CHURCH
6553-82558-0043 THE DIN OF BOISTEROUS MERRIMENT AND MUSIC'S ROAR IN SUDDEN PROCLAMATION BURST FROM HAUNT OF SATYRS IN SOME VIEWLESS GLADE
6553-82558-0044 BY A BROOK SIDE WE CAME A ROOFLESS PILE AND NOT BY REVERENTIAL TOUCH OF TIME DISMANTLED BUT BY VIOLENCE ABRUPT IN SPITE OF THOSE
6553-82558-0045 OF HOSPITALITY AND PEACEFUL REST AND WHEN THE PARTNER OF THOSE VARIED WALKS
6553-82558-0046 AND OF THAT BARREN PRIDE IN THEM WHO BY IMMUNITIES UNJUST
6553-82558-0047 LAID STRONGER HOLD DAILY UPON ME MIXED WITH PITY TOO AND LOVE FOR WHERE HOPE IS THERE LOVE WILL BE FOR THE ABJECT MULTITUDE AND WHEN WE CHANCED
6553-82558-0048 AND AT THE SIGHT MY FRIEND IN AGITATION SAID TIS AGAINST THAT THAT WE ARE FIGHTING
6553-82558-0049 AS SUM AND CROWN OF ALL
6553-82558-0050 WHENCE BETTER DAYS TO ALL MANKIND BUT THESE THINGS SET APART WAS NOT THIS SINGLE CONFIDENCE ENOUGH TO ANIMATE THE MIND THAT EVER TURNED A THOUGHT TO HUMAN WELFARE THAT HENCEFORTH

6553-82558-0052 AS A DEADLY MISCHIEF AND A FOUL AND BLACK DISHONOUR FRANCE WAS WEARY OF OH HAPPY TIME OF YOUTHFUL LOVERS THUS THE STORY MIGHT BEGIN
6553-82558-0053 HOW BETWEEN HEART AND HEART OPPRESSION THRUST HER MANDATES
6553-82558-0054 WHICH THROUGH FRANCE FULL SPEEDILY RESOUNDED PUBLIC HOPE OR PERSONAL MEMORY OF HIS OWN WORST WRONGS ROUSE HIM BUT HIDDEN IN THOSE GLOOMY SHADES HIS DAYS HE WASTED
